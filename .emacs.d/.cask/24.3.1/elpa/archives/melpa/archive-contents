;; Zotelo can be used in conjunction with any emacs mode but is primarily
;; intended for bibtex and RefTeX users.

"]) (zoom-frm . [(20140101 56) ((frame-fns (0)) (frame-cmds (0))) "Commands to zoom frame font size." single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;;  Commands to zoom into and out of text.  They zoom a frame or a
;;  buffer, so that the text appears larger or smaller.
;;
;;  Commands `zoom-in', `zoom-out', and `zoom-in/out' do both kinds of
;;  zooming.  They can behave like command `text-scale-adjust',
;;  zooming a buffer wherever it is displayed, or they can zoom an
;;  entire single frame (all of its windows).  Hit `C-u' at any time
;;  while using these commands to toggle between buffer and frame
;;  zooming.
;;
;;  Because it is a more general replacement for `text-scale-adjust',
;;  I suggest you bind `zoom-in/out' to the keys bound by default to
;;  `text-scale-adjust': `C-x C-+', `C-x C-=', `C-x C--', and `C-x
;;  C-0'.
;;
;;  It is also handy to use a mouse button or wheel for zooming, hence
;;  the mouse binding suggestions.  For example, binding `zoom-in' and
;;  `zoom-out' to mouse wheel events gives you the zooming effect you
;;  are perhaps used to in a Web browser.
;;
;;  User option `zoom-frame/buffer' determines which kind of zooming
;;  (frame or buffer) is used by default.  You can customize this
;;  option, but (in Emacs 23 or later) you can also toggle it just by
;;  providing a prefix arg (`C-u') to `zoom-in/out', `zoom-in', or
;;  `zoom-out'.
;;
;;  Note about saving changes made dynamically using the commands
;;  defined here:
;;
;;    Some of the commands defined here change frame properties.  You
;;    can save any changes you have made, by using Customize.  To
;;    visit a Customize buffer of all unsaved changes you have made,
;;    use command `customize-customized'.
;;
;;    Frame parameter changes, such as font size, can be saved for
;;    future use by all frames or all frames of a certain kind.  For
;;    that, you must change the frame parameters of the correponding
;;    frame-alist variable.
;;
;;    There is no single variable for saving changes to parameters of
;;    the current frame.  Instead, there are several different
;;    frame-alist variables, which you can use to define different
;;    kinds of frames.  These include: `default-frame-alist',
;;    `initial-frame-alist', and `special-display-frame-alist'.  The
;;    complete list of such frame alist variables is available using
;;    function `frame-alist-var-names', defined in library
;;    `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;    Example: Suppose you change the font size of a frame and want to
;;    make that the default font size for new frames in the future.
;;    You will need to update the value of variable
;;    `default-frame-alist' to use the `font' parameter setting of the
;;    changed frame.
;;
;;    You can easily copy one or all parameter values from any given
;;    frame to any frame alist (such as `default-frame-alist'), by
;;    using the commands `set-frame-alist-parameter-from-frame' and
;;    `set-all-frame-alist-parameters-from-frame'.  Those commands are
;;    defined in library `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `toggle-zoom-frame', `zoom-all-frames-in',
;;    `zoom-all-frames-out', `zoom-frm-in', `zoom-frm-out',
;;    `zoom-frm-unzoom', `zoom-in', `zoom-in/out' (Emacs 23+),
;;    `zoom-out'.
;;
;;
;;  User options (variables) defined here:
;;
;;    `frame-zoom-font-difference', `zoom-frame/buffer' (Emacs 23+).
;;
;;
;;  Put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'): (require 'zoom-frm)
;;
;;  Suggested key bindings:
;;
;;    Emacs 23 and later:
;;
;;    (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?+)] 'zoom-in/out)
;;    (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?-)] 'zoom-in/out)
;;    (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?=)] 'zoom-in/out)
;;    (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?0)] 'zoom-in/out)
;;
;;    Any Emacs version:
;;
;;    (global-set-key (if (boundp 'mouse-wheel-down-event) ; Emacs 22+
;;                        (vector (list 'control
;;                                      mouse-wheel-down-event))
;;                      [C-mouse-wheel])    ; Emacs 20, 21
;;                    'zoom-in)
;;    (when (boundp 'mouse-wheel-up-event) ; Emacs 22+
;;      (global-set-key (vector (list 'control mouse-wheel-up-event))
;;                      'zoom-out))
;;
;;    (global-set-key [S-mouse-1]    'zoom-in)
;;    (global-set-key [C-S-mouse-1]  'zoom-out)
;;    ;; Get rid of `mouse-set-font' or `mouse-appearance-menu':
;;    (global-set-key [S-down-mouse-1] nil)
;;
;;  The first two of the mouse bindings mean that in Emacs 22 or later
;;  you can hold the Control key and rotate the mouse wheel to zoom in
;;  and out, just as you might do in a Web browser.
;;
;;  (In Emacs 20 and 21, Control plus mouse wheeling zooms in, but to
;;  zoom out you need to use `C--' before wheeling with Control.  This
;;  is because Emacs 20 and 21 do not have separate events for the
;;  mouse wheel directions, and it is the prefix arg, not the wheel
;;  direction, that determines the effect.)
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `autofit-frame.el' - Automatically fit each frame to its
;;                          selected window.  Uses `fit-frame.el'.
;;

;;                          2) Incrementally resize a frame.
;;

;; yari.el provides an Emacs frontend to Ruby's `ri' documentation
;; tool. It offers lookup and completion.
;;
;; This version will load all completion targets the first time it's
;; invoked. This can be a significant startup time, but it will not
;; have to look up anything after that point.
;;
;; This library tries to be compatible with any version of `rdoc' gem.
;; Self-testing covers all versions from 1.0.1 to 2.5.8 (current).
;;
;; The main function you should use as interface to ri is M-x yari
;; (yari-helm is a variant using Helm input framework). I recommend to
;; bind it on some key local when you are ruby-mode. Here is the example:
;;
;; (defun ri-bind-key ()
;;   (local-set-key [f1] 'yari))
;;
;;  or
;;
;; (defun ri-bind-key ()
;;   (local-set-key [f1] 'yari-helm))
;;
;; (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'ri-bind-key)
;;
;; You can use C-u M-x yari to reload all completion targets.

;;      If it find, edit this page, otherwise show \342\200\234No link found at point.\342\200\235
;;      And you can type \342\200\234C-u\342\200\235 before call this command,
;;      then it will give you page name completing for edit.
;; \343\203\273 Reload or switch edit page:
;;      When you use command \342\200\230yaoddmuse-edit\342\200\231 or \342\200\230yaoddmuse-edit-default\342\200\231,
;;      it will prefer to switch edit page if already have one exist.
;;      If you want to reload edit page forcibly, just hit \342\200\234C-u\342\200\235 before
;;      execute command.
;; \343\203\273 Smart display edit page.
;;      Default, edit page buffer popup when current major-mode
;;      is not \342\200\230yaoddmuse-mode\342\200\231, or use switch edit page buffer
;;      when current major-mode is \342\200\230yaoddmuse-mode\342\200\231.
;; \343\203\273 Revert edit page:
;;      Command \342\200\230yaoddmuse-revert\342\200\231 revert current edit page and don\342\200\231t
;;      need input wiki name or page name.
;; \343\203\273 Browse page after post successful:
;;      If you type \342\200\234C-u\342\200\235 before call post command,
;;      will browse page after post successful.
;; \343\203\273 Post buffer to wiki:
;;      Command \342\200\230yaoddmuse-post-buffer\342\200\231 post special buffer to wiki,
;;      or use command \342\200\230yaoddmuse-post-current-buffer\342\200\231 post current buffer to wiki.

;;      will post special library to wiki, and not need input file path,
;;      it\342\200\231s so lazy! ;)
;; \343\203\273 Remember last summary:
;;      By default, yaoddmuse remember last `summary' string, if you input
;;      same `summary' as previous time, just hit RET.
;; \343\203\273 Pick up file name:
;;      By default, when you use command `yaoddmuse-post-library' and
;;      `yaoddmuse-post-library-default', those commands can pick up
;;      file name around point, if it's library name you want, just
;;      hit RET.  ;)
;; \343\203\273 Pick up page name:
;;      When you use commands `yaoddmuse-browse-page' or `yaoddmuse-browse-page-default',
;;      it will try to pick-up page name around point.
;; \343\203\273 Encode special file:
;;      If you post special file, such as picture or compress file,
;;      it can encode file content before post it.
;; \343\203\273 Redirect page:
;;      You can use command `yaoddmuse-redirect' redirect page.
;;      Just input page name that you want redirect to.

;;      Just input page name that you want delete.
;; \343\203\273 Insert special file:
;;      You can use command `yaoddmuse-insert-file-content' insert
;;      file content.
;;      This command will try to encode special file content, such as,
;;      picture or compress file.
;; \343\203\273 Save page:
;;      You can use command `yaoddmuse-save-as' save special page,
;;      such as picture or compress format, and it will notify you
;;      correct suffix to save.
;; \343\203\273 Toggle image view:
;;      By default, when got image page, it will decode image and view it.
;;      You can use command `yaoddmuse-toggle-image-status' to toggle
;;      image status for view different content.

;; This is a major mode for editing files in the YAML data
;; serialization format.  It was initially developed by Yoshiki
;; Kurihara and many features were added by Marshall Vandegrift.  As
;; YAML and Python share the fact that indentation determines
;; structure, this mode provides indentation and indentation command
;; behavior very similar to that of python-mode.

;;; Installation:

;; To install, just drop this file into a directory in your
;; `load-path' and (optionally) byte-compile it.  To automatically
;; handle files ending in '.yml', add something like:
;;
;;    (require 'yaml-mode)
;;    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.yml$\" . yaml-mode))
;;
;; to your .emacs file.
;;
;; Unlike python-mode, this mode follows the Emacs convention of not
;; binding the ENTER key to `newline-and-indent'.  To get this
;; behavior, add the key definition to `yaml-mode-hook':
;;
;;    (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook
;;     '(lambda ()

;; This is an XML-RPC client implementation in elisp, capable of both
;; synchronous and asynchronous method calls (using the url package's async
;; retrieval functionality).
;; XML-RPC is remote procedure calls over HTTP using XML to describe the
;; function call and return values.

;; xml-rpc.el represents XML-RPC datatypes as lisp values, automatically
;; converting to and from the XML datastructures as needed, both for method
;; parameters and return values, making using XML-RPC methods fairly
;; transparent to the lisp code.

;;; Installation:

;; If you use ELPA (http://tromey.com/elpa), you can install via the
;; M-x package-list-packages interface. This is preferrable as you
;; will have access to updates automatically.

;; Otherwise, just make sure this file in your load-path (usually
;; ~/.emacs.d is included) and put (require 'xml-rpc) in your
;; ~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/init.el file.

;;; Requirements

;; xml-rpc.el uses the url package for http handling and xml.el for
;; XML parsing. url is a part of the W3 browser package.  The url
;; package that is part of Emacs 22+ works great.
;;
;; xml.el is a part of GNU Emacs 21, but can also be downloaded from
;; here: <URL:ftp://ftp.codefactory.se/pub/people/daniel/elisp/xml.el>

;;; Bug reports

;; Please use M-x xml-rpc-submit-bug-report to report bugs.

;;; XML-RPC datatypes are represented as follows

;;          int:  42

;; ***** INSTALLATION *****
;;
;; * NOTE: this interface currently runs under Unix only.
;;
;; Installation steps:
;;
;; 0. (It is, of course, assumed that cscope is already properly
;;    installed on the current system.)
;;
;; 1. Install xcscope.el through your system package manager, MELPA or by
;;    loading the file with
;;
;;      (require 'xcscope)
;;
;; 2. Call (cscope-setup). This can go into the .emacs to always enable
;;    xcscope.el at emacs startup
;;
;; 3. If you intend to use xcscope.el often you can optionally edit your
;;    ~/.emacs file to add keybindings that reduce the number of keystrokes
;;    required.  For example, the following will add \"C-f#\" keybindings, which
;;    are easier to type than the usual \"C-c s\" prefixed keybindings.  Note
;;    that specifying \"global-map\" instead of \"cscope-minor-mode-keymap\" makes the
;;    keybindings available in all buffers:
;;
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f3)]  'cscope-set-initial-directory)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f4)]  'cscope-unset-initial-directory)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f5)]  'cscope-find-this-symbol)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f6)]  'cscope-find-global-definition)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f7)]
;;	  'cscope-find-global-definition-no-prompting)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f8)]  'cscope-pop-mark)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f9)]  'cscope-history-forward-line)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f10)] 'cscope-history-forward-file)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f11)] 'cscope-history-backward-line)
;;	(define-key global-map [(control f12)] 'cscope-history-backward-file)
;;      (define-key global-map [(meta f9)]  'cscope-display-buffer)
;;      (define-key global-map [(meta f10)] 'cscope-display-buffer-toggle)
;;
;; 6. Restart (X)Emacs.  That's it.
;;
;;
;;
;;
;; ***** USING THIS MODULE *****
;;
;; * Basic usage:
;;
;; If all of your C/C++/lex/yacc source files are in the same
;; directory, you can just start using this module.  If your files are
;; spread out over multiple directories, see \"Advanced usage\", below.
;;
;; Just edit a source file, and use the pull-down or pop-up (button 3)
;; menus to select one of:
;;
;;         Find symbol
;;         Find global definition
;;         Find called functions
;;         Find functions calling a function
;;         Find text string
;;         Find egrep pattern
;;         Find a file
;;         Find files #including a file
;;
;; The cscope database will be automatically created in the same
;; directory as the source files (assuming that you've never used
;; cscope before), and a buffer will pop-up displaying the results.
;; You can then use button 2 (the middle button) on the mouse to edit
;; the selected file, or you can move the text cursor over a selection
;; and press [Enter].
;;
;; The third mouse button is bound to a popup menu for cscope. Shift-mouse
;; button 3 invokes the last find command again. E.g. if you look for the symbol
;; 'main' and afterwards you want to look for another symbol, just press Shift
;; and click the third button.
;;
;; Each cscope search adds its results to the *cscope* buffer. These sets of
;; results can be navigated and manupulated similar to patches in diff-mode.:
;;
;;  - n/p navigates over individual results
;;  - k kills individual results
;;
;;  - N/P or M-n/M-p navigates over file results
;;  - M-k kills file results
;;
;;  - M-N/M-P navigates over result sets
;;  - M-K kills result sets
;;
;;  - Navigation from outside the *cscope* buffer (C-c s n/p/N/P) is restricted to
;;    the result set at (point)
;;
;; Any result set in the *cscope* buffer can be re-run with the 'r' key.
;;
;;
;; * Locating the cscope databases:
;;
;; This module will first use the variable, `cscope-database-regexps', to search
;; for a suitable database directory. If a database location cannot be found
;; using this variable then a search is begun at the variable,
;; `cscope-initial-directory', if set. If not set and we're running this search
;; from the *cscope* buffer, the search is begun from the directory of the
;; search at point. Otherwise, the current directory is used. If the directory
;; is not a cscope database directory then the directory's parent, parent's
;; parent, etc. is searched until a cscope database directory is found, or the
;; root directory is reached. If the root directory is reached, the current
;; directory will be used.
;;
;; A cscope database directory is one in which EITHER a cscope database
;; file (e.g., \"cscope.out\") OR a cscope file list (e.g.,
;; \"cscope.files\") exists.  If only \"cscope.files\" exists, the
;; corresponding \"cscope.out\" will be automatically created by cscope
;; when a search is done.  By default, the cscope database file is called
;; \"cscope.out\", but this can be changed (on a global basis) via the
;; variable, `cscope-database-file'.  There is limited support for cscope
;; databases that are named differently than that given by
;; `cscope-database-file', using the variable, `cscope-database-regexps'.
;;
;; Note that the variable, `cscope-database-regexps', is generally not
;; needed, as the normal hierarchical database search is sufficient
;; for placing and/or locating the cscope databases.  However, there
;; may be cases where it makes sense to place the cscope databases
;; away from where the source files are kept; in this case, this
;; variable is used to determine the mapping.  One use for this
;; variable is when you want to share the database file with other
;; users; in this case, the database may be located in a directory
;; separate from the source files.  
;;
;; Setting the variable, `cscope-initial-directory', is useful when a
;; search is to be expanded by specifying a cscope database directory
;; that is a parent of the directory that this module would otherwise
;; use.  For example, consider a project that contains the following
;; cscope database directories:
;;
;;     /users/jdoe/sources
;;     /users/jdoe/sources/proj1
;;     /users/jdoe/sources/proj2
;;
;; If a search is initiated from a .c file in /users/jdoe/sources/proj1
;; then (assuming the variable, `cscope-database-regexps', is not set)
;; /users/jdoe/sources/proj1 will be used as the cscope data base directory.
;; Only matches in files in /users/jdoe/sources/proj1 will be found.  This
;; can be remedied by typing \"C-c s a\" and then \"M-del\" to remove single
;; path element in order to use a cscope database directory of
;; /users/jdoe/sources.  Normal searching can be restored by typing \"C-c s A\".
;;
;;
;; * Keybindings:
;;
;; All keybindings use the \"C-c s\" prefix, but are usable only while
;; editing a source file, or in the cscope results buffer:
;;
;;      C-c s s         Find symbol.
;;      C-c s =         Find assignments to this symbol
;;      C-c s d         Find global definition.
;;      C-c s g         Find global definition (alternate binding).
;;      C-c s G         Find global definition without prompting.
;;      C-c s c         Find functions calling a function.
;;      C-c s C         Find called functions (list functions called
;;                      from a function).
;;      C-c s t         Find text string.
;;      C-c s e         Find egrep pattern.
;;      C-c s f         Find a file.
;;      C-c s i         Find files #including a file.
;;
;; These pertain to navigation through the search results:
;;
;;      C-c s b         Display *cscope* buffer.
;;      C-c s B         Auto display *cscope* buffer toggle.
;;      C-c s n         Next symbol.
;;      C-c s N         Next file.
;;      C-c s p         Previous symbol.
;;      C-c s P         Previous file.
;;      C-c s u         Pop mark.
;;
;; These pertain to setting and unsetting the variable,
;; `cscope-initial-directory', (location searched for the cscope database
;;  directory):
;;
;;      C-c s a         Set initial directory.
;;      C-c s A         Unset initial directory.
;;
;; These pertain to cscope database maintenance:
;;
;;      C-c s L         Create list of files to index.
;;      C-c s I         Create list and index.
;;      C-c s E         Edit list of files to index.
;;      C-c s W         Locate this buffer's cscope directory
;;                      (\"W\" --> \"where\").
;;      C-c s S         Locate this buffer's cscope directory.
;;                      (alternate binding: \"S\" --> \"show\").
;;      C-c s T         Locate this buffer's cscope directory.
;;                      (alternate binding: \"T\" --> \"tell\").
;;      C-c s D         Dired this buffer's directory.
;;
;;
;; * Advanced usage:
;;
;; If the source files are spread out over multiple directories,
;; you've got a few choices:
;;
;; 1. If all of the directories exist below a common directory
;;    (without any extraneous, unrelated subdirectories), you can tell
;;    this module to place the cscope database into the top-level,
;;    common directory.  This assumes that you do not have any cscope
;;    databases in any of the subdirectories.  If you do, you should
;;    delete them; otherwise, they will take precedence over the
;;    top-level database.
;;
;;    If you do have cscope databases in any subdirectory, the
;;    following instructions may not work right.
;;
;;    It's pretty easy to tell this module to use a top-level, common
;;    directory:
;;
;;    a. Make sure that the menu pick, \"Cscope/Index recursively\", is
;;       checked (the default value).
;;
;;    b. Select the menu pick, \"Cscope/Create list and index\", and
;;       specify the top-level directory. This will index the sources
;;       in the background, so you can do other things if indexing
;;       takes a long time. A list of files to index will be created in
;;       \"cscope.files\", and the cscope database will be created in
;;       \"cscope.out\".
;;
;;    Once this has been done, you can then use the menu picks
;;    (described in \"Basic usage\", above) to search for symbols.
;;
;;    Note, however, that, if you add or delete source files, you'll
;;    have to either rebuild the database using the above procedure,
;;    or edit the file, \"cscope.files\" to add/delete the names of the
;;    source files.  To edit this file, you can use the menu pick,
;;    \"Cscope/Edit list of files to index\".
;;
;;
;; 2. If most of the files exist below a common directory, but a few
;;    are outside, you can use the menu pick, \"Cscope/Create list of
;;    files to index\", and specify the top-level directory.  Make sure
;;    that \"Cscope/Index recursively\", is checked before you do so,
;;    though.  You can then edit the list of files to index using the
;;    menu pick, \"Cscope/Edit list of files to index\".  Just edit the
;;    list to include any additional source files not already listed.
;;
;;    Once you've created, edited, and saved the list, you can then
;;    use the menu picks described under \"Basic usage\", above, to
;;    search for symbols.  The first time you search, you will have to
;;    wait a while for cscope to fully index the source files, though.
;;    If you have a lot of source files, you may want to manually run
;;    cscope to build the database:
;;
;;            cd top-level-directory    # or wherever
;;            rm -f cscope.out          # not always necessary
;;            cscope -b
;;
;;
;; 3. If the source files are scattered in many different, unrelated
;;    places, you'll have to manually create cscope.files and put a
;;    list of all pathnames into it.  Then build the database using:
;;
;;            cd some-directory         # wherever cscope.files exists
;;            rm -f cscope.out          # not always necessary
;;            cscope -b
;;
;;    Next, read the documentation for the variable,
;;    \"cscope-database-regexps\", and set it appropriately, such that
;;    the above-created cscope database will be referenced when you
;;    edit a related source file.
;;
;;    Once this has been done, you can then use the menu picks
;;    described under \"Basic usage\", above, to search for symbols.
;;
;;
;; * Interesting configuration variables:
;;
;; \"cscope-truncate-lines\"
;;      This is the value of `truncate-lines' to use in cscope
;;      buffers; the default is the current setting of
;;      `truncate-lines'.  This variable exists because it can be
;;      easier to read cscope buffers with truncated lines, while
;;      other buffers do not have truncated lines.
;;
;; \"cscope-use-relative-paths\"
;;      If non-nil, use relative paths when creating the list of files
;;      to index.  The path is relative to the directory in which the
;;      cscope database will be created.  If nil, absolute paths will
;;      be used.  Absolute paths are good if you plan on moving the
;;      database to some other directory (if you do so, you'll
;;      probably also have to modify `cscope-database-regexps').
;;      Absolute paths may also be good if you share the database file
;;      with other users (you'll probably want to specify some
;;      automounted network path for this).
;;
;; \"cscope-index-recursively\"
;;      If non-nil, index files in the current directory and all
;;      subdirectories.  If nil, only files in the current directory
;;      are indexed.  This variable is only used when creating the
;;      list of files to index, or when creating the list of files and
;;      the corresponding cscope database.
;;
;; \"cscope-name-line-width\"
;;      The width of the combined \"function name:line number\" field in
;;      the cscope results buffer.  If negative, the field is
;;      left-justified.
;;
;; \"cscope-option-....\" Various options passed to the 'cscope' process. Controls
;;      things like include directories, database compression, database type,
;;      etc.
;;
;; \"cscope-display-cscope-buffer\" 
;;      If non-nil, display the *cscope* buffer after each search
;;      (default).  This variable can be set in order to reduce the
;;      number of keystrokes required to navigate through the matches.
;;
;; \"cscope-database-regexps\"
;; 	List to force directory-to-cscope-database mappings.
;; 	This is a list of `(REGEXP DBLIST [ DBLIST ... ])', where:
;;
;; 	REGEXP is a regular expression matched against the current buffer's
;; 	current directory.  The current buffer is typically some source file,
;; 	and you're probably searching for some symbol in or related to this
;; 	file.  Basically, this regexp is used to relate the current directory
;; 	to a cscope database.  You need to start REGEXP with \"^\" if you want
;; 	to match from the beginning of the current directory.
;;
;; 	DBLIST is a list that contains one or more of:
;;
;; 	    ( DBDIR )
;; 	    ( DBDIR ( OPTIONS ) )
;; 	    ( t )
;; 	    t
;;
;; 	Here, DBDIR is a directory (or a file) that contains a cscope
;; 	database.  If DBDIR is a directory, then it is expected that the
;; 	cscope database, if present, has the filename given by the variable,
;; 	`cscope-database-file'; if DBDIR is a file, then DBDIR is the path
;; 	name to a cscope database file (which does not have to be the same as
;; 	that given by `cscope-database-file').  If only DBDIR is specified,
;; 	then that cscope database will be searched without any additional
;; 	cscope command-line options.  If OPTIONS is given, then OPTIONS is a
;; 	list of strings, where each string is a separate cscope command-line
;; 	option.
;;
;; 	In the case of \"( t )\", this specifies that the search is to use the
;; 	normal hierarchical database search.  This option is used to
;; 	explicitly search using the hierarchical database search either before
;; 	or after other cscope database directories.
;;
;; 	If \"t\" is specified (not inside a list), this tells the searching
;; 	mechanism to stop searching if a match has been found (at the point
;; 	where \"t\" is encountered).  This is useful for those projects that
;; 	consist of many subprojects.  You can specify the most-used
;; 	subprojects first, followed by a \"t\", and then followed by a master
;; 	cscope database directory that covers all subprojects.  This will
;; 	cause the most-used subprojects to be searched first (hopefully
;; 	quickly), and the search will then stop if a match was found.  If not,
;; 	the search will continue using the master cscope database directory.
;;
;; 	Here, `cscope-database-regexps' is generally not used, as the normal
;; 	hierarchical database search is sufficient for placing and/or locating
;; 	the cscope databases.  However, there may be cases where it makes
;; 	sense to place the cscope databases away from where the source files
;; 	are kept; in this case, this variable is used to determine the
;; 	mapping.
;;
;; 	This module searches for the cscope databases by first using this
;; 	variable; if a database location cannot be found using this variable,
;; 	then the current directory is searched, then the parent, then the
;; 	parent's parent, until a cscope database directory is found, or the
;; 	root directory is reached.  If the root directory is reached, the
;; 	current directory will be used.
;;
;; 	A cscope database directory is one in which EITHER a cscope database
;; 	file (e.g., \"cscope.out\") OR a cscope file list (e.g.,
;; 	\"cscope.files\") exists.  If only \"cscope.files\" exists, the
;; 	corresponding \"cscope.out\" will be automatically created by cscope
;; 	when a search is done.  By default, the cscope database file is called
;; 	\"cscope.out\", but this can be changed (on a global basis) via the
;; 	variable, `cscope-database-file'.  There is limited support for cscope
;; 	databases that are named differently than that given by
;; 	`cscope-database-file', using the variable, `cscope-database-regexps'.
;;
;; 	Here is an example of `cscope-database-regexps':
;;
;;		(setq cscope-database-regexps
;;		      '(
;;			( \"^/users/jdoe/sources/proj1\"
;;			  ( t )
;;			  ( \"/users/jdoe/sources/proj2\")
;;			  ( \"/users/jdoe/sources/proj3/mycscope.out\")
;;			  ( \"/users/jdoe/sources/proj4\")
;;			  t
;;			  ( \"/some/master/directory\" (\"-d\" \"-I/usr/local/include\") )
;;			  )
;;			( \"^/users/jdoe/sources/gnome/\"
;;			  ( \"/master/gnome/database\" (\"-d\") )
;;			  )
;;			))
;;
;; 	If the current buffer's directory matches the regexp,
;; 	\"^/users/jdoe/sources/proj1\", then the following search will be
;; 	done:
;;
;; 	    1. First, the normal hierarchical database search will be used to
;;	       locate a cscope database.

;; 2. The support for cscope databases different from that specified by

;;    will not be auto-created (unlike files names by
;;    `cscope-database-file').  You can manually force the file to be
;;    created by using touch(1) to create a zero-length file; the
;;    database will be created the next time a search is done.

;; wrap-region is a minor mode that wraps a region with
;; punctuations. For tagged markup modes, such as HTML and XML, it
;; wraps with tags.
;;
;; To use wrap-region, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path:
;;   (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/directory/or/file\")
;;
;; Then require wrap-region:
;;   (require 'wrap-region)

;; To start wrap-region:
;;   (wrap-region-mode t) or M-x wrap-region-mode
;;
;; If you only want wrap-region active in some mode, use hooks:
;;   (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'wrap-region-mode)
;;
;; Or if you want to activate it in all buffers, use the global mode:
;;   (wrap-region-global-mode t)

;; To wrap a region, select that region and hit one of the punctuation
;; keys. In \"tag-modes\"\" (see `wrap-region-tag-active-modes'), \"<\" is
;; replaced and wraps the region with a tag. To activate this behavior
;; in a mode that is not default:
;;   (add-to-list 'wrap-region-tag-active-modes 'some-tag-mode)
;;
;; `wrap-region-table' contains the default punctuations
;; that wraps. You can add and remove new wrappers by using the

;; `wrap-region-remove-wrapper' respectively.
;;   (wrap-region-add-wrapper \"`\" \"'\")                  ; hit ` then region -> `region'

;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Window-end-visible.el has no user-level interface, and is only
;; useful when programming Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This library provides the function `window-end-visible', which
;; works around a limitation of `window-end', at a speed penalty.
;;
;; The issue this function solves is that the following is not true
;; as might be expected:
;;
;;    (pos-visible-in-window-p (window-end))
;;
;; `window-end-visible' returns the \"true\" window end: the last
;; visible position in the window, verified by testing with
;; `pos-visible-in-window-p'.
;;
;; The speed penalty of `window-end-visible' over `window-end' varies
;; depending on your configuration.  For example, tabbar.el makes
;; calling `pos-visible-in-window-p' quite expensive.
;;
;; To use window-end-visible, place the window-end-visible.el library
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs
;; file:
;;
;;     (require 'window-end-visible)

"]) (win-switch . [(20130202 937) nil "fast, dynamic bindings for window-switching/resizing" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;;  If you use multiple windows in an Emacs frame, you may find yourself
;;  moving through the window configuration using `other-window' (C-x o)
;;  again and again. Because the order of windows in the window list
;;  need not relate intuitively to windows' positions, moving
;;  efficiently can require context-specific prefix arguments along the
;;  way. The tiring outcome is that navigation through a complex window
;;  configuration demands many keystrokes and nontrivial attention.
;;  This package is designed to solve that problem.
;;
;;  While the `windmove' package provides functions for moving
;;  intuitively among windows, the natural key bindings for these
;;  functions (e.g., the arrow keys with some modifier) require a
;;  distant and thus inefficient hand movement. Moreover, one often
;;  wants to mix a variety of window-based operations (other-window,
;;  previous-window, directional movement, resizing) in rapid
;;  succession.
;;
;;  This package builds on the windmove functionality by defining a
;;  command `win-switch-dispatch' that engages a dynamic, transient
;;  keyboard override, allowing one to efficiently move among defined
;;  windows (and frames) -- and even resize, split, delete them -- with
;;  minimal fuss and effort. When the override is engaged, the movement
;;  and resizing commands are bound to simple keys that can be pressed
;;  quickly with one hand. The override ends either when the user exits
;;  explicitly or after a configurable idle time threshold. The happy
;;  outcome is fast and seamless navigation.
;;
;;  To use the package, execute the following code either directly
;;  or in your .emacs file:
;;
;;      (require 'win-switch)
;;      (global-set-key \"\\C-xo\" 'win-switch-dispatch)
;;
;;  or use whatever keybinding you ordinarily have set to `other-window'.
;;  Alternatively, you can use one of a variety of predefined configuration
;;  commands, as in
;;
;;      (require 'win-switch)
;;      (win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl \"\\C-xo\")
;;
;;  which has the same effect as the above.
;;
;;  Now, when executing a window switch (i.e., hitting C-xo), Emacs enters
;;  window switching mode, which lasts until either the user exits the
;;  mode or the idle time exceeds the threshold `win-switch-idle-time'.
;;  During this override, selected keys move among windows (or frames)
;;  or resize the windows. The following keys are bound by default:
;;
;;    + i select the window above the current window.
;;    + k select the window below the current window.
;;    + j select the window left of the current window.
;;    + l select the window right of the current window.
;;    + o cycle forward through the window list in the current frame.
;;    + p cycle backward through the window list in the current frame.
;;    + SPACE cycles among existing frames.
;;    + u (and RETURN) exit window switching mode.
;;    + I and K vertically enlarge and shrink the current window, respectively.
;;    + L and J horizontally enlarge and shrink the current window, respectively.
;;    + h and ; split the current window, horizontally and vertically, respectively.
;;    + ESCAPE acts as an \"emergency\" exit
;;
;;  All other keys exit window switching mode and execute their original function.
;;
;;  By default, window selection wraps around when moving across a frame
;;  edge and window switching mode is forgone when there are only two
;;  windows. But these features, the key bindings, and other parameters
;;  can all be customized, either with the customization facility or
;;  with defvar and setter functions.
;;
;;  The default keybindings are designed for fast and intuitve,
;;  one-handed operation, but if desired the key bindings can be easily
;;  adjusted or reset. Several alternative key configurations are pre-defined
;;  (see `win-switch-setup-keys-ijkl', `win-switch-setup-keys-arrow-ctrl',
;;  `win-switch-setup-keys-arrow-meta', and `win-switch-setup-keys-esdf'
;;  below). The keys also can be rebound in groups via the variables
;;  `win-switch-<name>-keys' where <name> can be one of up, down, left,
;;  right, next-window, previous-window, enlarge-vertically,
;;  shrink-vertically, enlarge-horizontally, shrink-horizontally,
;;  other-frame, exit, split-vertically, split-horizontally, delete-window,
;;  or emergency-exit. These variables should not be set directly,
;;  but rather should be set either by customize or by
;;  using the functions `win-switch-add-key', `win-switch-delete-key',
;;  and `win-switch-set-keys'. For example:

;;    (win-switch-delete-key \"p\" 'previous-window)
;;    (win-switch-set-keys   '(\" \" \",\" \"m\") 'other-frame)
;;
;;  Note that the last arguments here are win-switch commands not elisp
;;  functions. (Note also that the emergency-exit keys do a hard exit in
;;  case of an unexpected error in user-defined code such as in
;;  customized feedback functions. This command may be removed in future
;;  versions.) At least one exit key must always be defined. Revised
;;  bindings can be set in in the hook `win-switch-load-hook' before
;;  loading the package. (Also see `win-switch-define-key' for setting
;;  general commands in the win-switch keymap, and
;;  `win-switch-set-once-key' for setting commands in the once only
;;  keymap used by `win-switch-dispatch-once'.)
;;
;;  Besides key bindings, the most important customization options are
;;  the following:
;;
;;    + `win-switch-idle-time'
;;    + `win-switch-window-threshold'
;;    + `win-switch-other-window-first'
;;    + `win-switch-wrap-around'  (set via `win-switch-set-wrap-around')
;;
;;  The idle time should be set so that one does not have to either rush
;;  or wait. (While explicit exit always works, it is nice to have
;;  window-switching mode end on its own at just the right time.) This
;;  may require some personalized fiddling to find a comfortable value,
;;  though the default should be pretty good. The window-threshold and
;;  other-window-first control when and if window switching mode is
;;  entered. And wrap-around determines if moving across the edge of the
;;  frame wraps around to the window on the other side.
;;
;;  The other customizable parameters are as follows:
;;
;;    + `win-switch-provide-visual-feedback'
;;    + `win-switch-feedback-background-color'
;;    + `win-switch-feedback-foreground-color'
;;    + `win-switch-on-feedback-function'
;;    + `win-switch-off-feedback-function'
;;    + `win-switch-other-window-function'
;;
;;  The feedback mechanisms are intended to make it salient when
;;  window switching mode is on or off and can be customized at
;;  several scales. The other-window-function replaces `other-window'
;;  for moving between window; the primary motivation is to allow
;;  `icicle-other-window-or-frame' under icicles.
;;
;;  And three hooks can be set as well:
;;
;;    + `win-switch-load-hook'
;;    + `win-switch-on-hook'
;;    + `win-switch-off-hook'
;;
;;  The following functions are used to set options:
;;
;;    + `win-switch-set-wrap-around'
;;    + `win-switch-add-key'
;;    + `win-switch-delete-key'
;;    + `win-switch-set-keys'
;;
;;  There are three main entry points for using this functionality
;;
;;    + `win-switch-dispatch' (alias `win-switch-mode')
;;    + `win-switch-dispatch-once'
;;    + `win-switch-dispatch-with'
;;
;;  The first is the main function, the second is a prefix command that
;;  gives one switch only but allows easy maneuvering in up to five
;;  windows with a single keystroke. (The `once' keys can be set using
;;  the `win-switch-set-once-keys' command.) The last constructs
;;  commands for keybindings that dispatch after some other command.
;;  (See `win-switch-setup-keys-arrow' for a nice example of its use.)
;;
;;  NOTE: win-switch is not a formal major or minor mode, more of an
;;        overriding mode. This started as a way to explore dynamic
;;        keybindings, an idea that is generalized considerably in
;;        my packages `quick-nav' and `power-keys'. The latter
;;        introduces some programming abstractions that can be used
;;        to easily install dynamic keymaps of several flavors.
;;        I plan to use the `power-keys' mechanisms for this package
;;        in a later version.

;;
;;     (require 'wiki-nav)
;;
;;     (global-wiki-nav-mode 1)
;;
;;     Sprinkle double-bracketed [[links]] in your code comments
;;
;; [[<Explanation]]
;;
;; Wiki-nav.el is a minor mode which recognizes [[wiki-style]]
;; double-bracketed navigation links in any type of file, providing
;; the ability to jump between sections, between files, or open
;; external links.
;;
;; Wiki-nav.el requires button-lock.el, which in turn requires
;; font-lock.el.  Font-lock.el is provided with Emacs.
;; Button-lock.el is available here
;;
;;     http://github.com/rolandwalker/button-lock
;;
;; [[<Example usage]]
;;
;;     Add the following to your ~/.emacs
;;
;;         (require 'wiki-nav)
;;         (global-wiki-nav-mode 1)
;;
;;     and sprinkle
;;
;;         [[links]]
;;
;;     throughout your files.  That's it.  There's more functionality,
;;     but simple [[links]] may be all you need.
;;
;;     Clicking a [[link]] will invoke a text search for the next
;;     matching link.  Double-clicking a link will search for matching
;;     links in all open buffers.
;;
;;     Text-matching between links is always case-insensitive.
;;
;;     To navigate upward to a previous matching link, add a '<'
;;     symbol before the search text
;;
;;         [[<links]]
;;
;;     You can insert the '>' symbol, too, but that simply indicates
;;     the default forward-search navigation.
;;
;;     Both forward and backward navigation will wrap around the ends
;;     of the file without prompting.
;;
;;     Leading and trailing space inside a link is ignored.
;;
;;     From the keyboard:
;;
;;         control-c w   skip forward in the buffer to the next link
;;
;;         control-c W   skip backward in the buffer to the previous link
;;
;;         return        if positioned on a link, activate it
;;
;;         tab           if positioned on a link, skip forward in the
;;                       buffer to the next link of any kind (need not
;;                       match the current link)
;;
;;         S-tab         if positioned on a link, skip backward in the
;;                       buffer to the previous link of any kind (need not
;;                       not match the current link)
;;
;; Advanced usage:
;;
;;     Bracketed links may contain external URLs
;;
;;         [[http://google.com]]
;;
;;     Or they may use various internally-recognized URI schemes:
;;
;;     visit: navigates to another file
;;
;;         [[visit:/etc/hosts]]
;;
;;         [[visit:/path/to/another/file:NameOfLink]]
;;
;;     func: navigates to the definition of a function
;;
;;         [[func:main]]
;;
;;     line: navigates to a line number
;;
;;         [[line:12]]
;;
;;     visit: may be combined with other schemes:
;;
;;         [[visit:/path/to/another/file:func:main]]
;;
;;         [[visit:/etc/hosts:line:5]]
;;
;;     Path names and similar strings are subjected to URI-style
;;     unescaping before lookup.  To link a filename which contains a
;;     colon, substitute \"%3A\" for the colon character.
;;
;;     See the documentation for the function wiki-nav for more
;;     information.

;;
;; [[<Notes]]
;;
;;     wiki-nav uses industry-standard left-clicks rather than
;;     Emacs-traditional middle clicks.
;;
;;     It is difficult to edit the text inside a link using the
;;     mouse.  To make a link inactive, position the point after the
;;     link and backspace into it.  Once the trailing delimiters have
;;     been modified, the link reverts to ordinary text.
;;
;; [[<Bugs]]
;;
;;     Only highlights first match on each comment line.
;;
;;     Double-square-brackets represent a valid construct in some
;;     programming languages (especially shell), and may be mistakenly
;;     linked.  Workaround: don't click.  Second workaround: add mode to
;;     wiki-nav-comment-only-modes via customize.  Third workaround:
;;     change delimiters triple-square-brackets via customize.
;;
;;     Newlines are not escaped in regexp fields in customize.
;;
;;     Case-sensitivity on matching the delimiters is unknown because
;;     it depends on how font-lock-defaults was called for the current
;;     mode.  However, this is not an issue unless the default delimiters
;;     are changed to use alphabetical characters.
;;
;;     Auto-complete interacts and causes keyboard interaction
;;     problems.  Auto-complete should be suppressed if the point is
;;     on a link?
;;
;;     Difficult to reproduce: keystrokes sometimes leaking through to
;;     the editor during keyboard navigation.  Tends to happen on first
;;     navigation, when key is pressed quickly?
;;
;;     The global minor mode causes button-lock to be turned off/back
;;     on for every buffer.

"]) (wiki . [(20120807 1458) nil "hypertext authoring the WikiWay" single ";;; Commentary:

;; Wiki is a hypertext and a content management system: Normal users are
;; encouraged to enhance the hypertext by editing and refactoring
;; existing pages and by adding more pages.  This is made easy by
;; requiring a certain way of writing pages.  It is not as complicated
;; as a markup language such as HTML.  The general idea is to write
;; plain ASCII.  Word with mixed case such as ThisOne are WikiNames --
;; they may be a Link or they may not.  If they are, clicking them will
;; take you to the page with that WikiName; if they are not, clicking
;; them will create an empty page for you to fill out.

;; This mode does all of this for you without using a web browser, cgi
;; scripts, databases, etc.  All you need is Emacs!  In order to
;; install, put wiki.el on you load-path, and add the following to your
;; .emacs file:

;; (require 'wiki)

;; This will activate WikiMode for all files in `wiki-directories' as soon
;; as they are opened.  This works by adding `wiki-maybe' to
;; `find-file-hooks'.

;; Emacs provides the functionality usually found on Wiki web sites
;; automatically: To find out how many pages have links to your page,
;; use `grep' or `dired-do-search'.  To get an index of all wikis, use
;; `dired'.  To keep old versions around, use `version-control' or use
;; `vc-next-action'.  To edit wikis, use Emacs!

;; You can publish a wiki using `wiki-publish', or you can use
;; `dired-do-wiki-publish' to publish marked wikis from dired, or you
;; can use `wiki-publish-all' to publish all wikis and write an index
;; file.  This will translate your plain text wikis into HTML according
;; to the rules defined in `wiki-pub-rules'.

;; Find out more: Take a look at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?StartingPoints

;;; XEmacs

;; XEmacs users will have to get easy-mmode.el, I'm afraid.  You should
;; be able to get easy-mmode.el from a web site carrying the Emacs
;; sources.  It loads fine, so that shouldn't be a problem.  Put
;; `easy-mmode' somewhere in your load-path and install as follows:

;; (require 'easy-mmode)
;; (require 'wiki)

;;; What about a Major Mode?

;; By default, wiki files will be in `fundamental-mode'.  I prefer to be
;; in `text-mode', instead.  You can do this either for all files that
;; have WikiNames by changing `auto-mode-alist', or you can make
;; text-mode the default mode instead of fundamental mode.  Example:

;; (setq default-major-mode 'text-mode)

;; This puts wiki files in `text-mode'.  One problem remains, however.
;; Text mode usually means that the apostrophe is considered to be part
;; of words, and some WikiNames will not be highlighted correctly, such
;; as \"WikiName''''s\".  In that case, change the syntax table, if you
;; don't mind the side effects.  Example:

;; (modify-syntax-entry ?' \".\" text-mode-syntax-table)

"]) (wide-n . [(20131227 210) nil "Cycle among buffer restrictions" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;;    This library modifies commands `narrow-to-region',
;;    `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' (`C-x n n', `C-x n d',
;;    and `C-x n p') so that the current buffer restriction
;;    (narrowing) is added to a list of restrictions for the current
;;    buffer, `wide-n-restrictions'.
;;
;;    You can then use `C-x n x' to cycle among previous buffer
;;    restrictions.  Repeating `x' repeats the action: `C-x n x x x x'
;;    etc.  Each time you hit `x' a different narrowing is made
;;    current.  This gives you an easy way to browse your past
;;    narrowings.
;;
;;    Invoking `C-x n x' with a prefix argument changes the behavior
;;    as follows:
;;
;;    * A plain prefix arg (`C-u') widens the buffer completely.
;;
;;    * A zero numeric prefix arg (e.g `C-0') widens completely
;;      and resets (empties) the list of restrictions.
;;
;;    * A numeric prefix arg N takes you directly to the abs(N)th
;;      previous restriction.  That is, it widens abs(N) times.
;;      Positive and negative args work the same, except that a
;;      negative arg also pops entries off the ring: it removes the
;;      ring entries from the most recent back through the (-)Nth one.
;;
;;    Be default, `C-x n x' is bound to command `wide-n-repeat'.  If
;;    you use Emacs 21 then you will want to change this key binding
;;    to command `wide-n', which is a non-repeatable version.
;;    Repeatability is not available before Emacs 22.
;;
;;    Emacs markers are used to record restriction limits, so the same
;;    restriction is available even if you modify its context.  If for
;;    any reason `wide-n-restrictions' ever has any entries that use
;;    buffer positions (numbers) instead of markers, invoking `wide-n'
;;    corrects this by changing the positions to markers.
;;
;;    This means that you can serialize `wide-n-restrictions',
;;    converting all markers to positions, save the value
;;    persistently, and restore it later.  Library `bookmark+.el' does
;;    this in order to let you bookmark and restore a list of
;;    restrictions.
;;
;;    In normal use, only the interactive use of commands
;;    `narrow-to-region', `narrow-to-defun', and `narrow-to-page' is
;;    affected by this library.  When these functions are called
;;    non-interactively there is normally no change to the value of
;;    variable `wide-n-restrictions'.  However, if for some reason you
;;    want to add entries to the restrictions ring when narrowing with
;;    some Emacs-Lisp code (i.e. non-interactively), you can do so by
;;    binding variable `wide-n-push-anyway-p' around the narrowing
;;    call.
;;
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `wide-n', `wide-n-repeat',
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:

;;    `wide-n-markerize', `wide-n-push', `wide-n-repeat-command'.

"]) (wide-column . [(20120814 112) nil "Calls functions dependant on column position." single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package is designed to run functions depending on the column
;; that the cursor is in.  My initial idea with it, is just to have it
;; change the cursor colour, lightening it as you go over the fill
;; column length.
;;
;; The point of this is that monitor sizes have in recent years got
;; plain silly, and its now relatively easy to buy one the size of a
;; small wardrobe.  Combined with the other wise wonderful
;; `dabbrev-expand' which makes it feasible to use very explantory,
;; and very long variable, and function names, source code has a habit
;; of becoming stupidly wide.  Now of course this wouldn't matter very
;; much, if we all had wide screens.  However in recent years, flat
;; screen monitors have become widely prevelant, and these generally
;; have lower resolutions, and smaller screen sizes, unless you are
;; very rich.  This raises the nasty possibility of a split therefore
;; in behaviour between those using LCD, and CRT based monitors.
;; Coming, as I do, from the left of the political spectrum, naturally
;; I find such divisiveness worrying.  This, therefore, is my
;; contribution to preventing it.
;;
;; This package functions as a normal minor mode, so
;; `wide-column-mode' toggles it on and off. There is also a global
;; minor mode which you can access with `global-wide-column-mode'
;; (Emacs 21 only). There is a problem with the getting the default
;; cursor colour; this happens when wide-column is loaded, and I can't
;; get around it without a hook in `set-cursor-color'. Set the
;; variable `wide-column-default-cursor-colour' which will solve this
;; problem.

;;; Issues;
;;
;; 1) I'm not sure about the error handling. I think things are
;; working quite well. However if the affector function crashes out,
;; it will appear to the user that wide-column mode is on, but
;; actually, it will be disabled. I can solve this easily, by
;; switching the mode off on errors, but easy-mmode produces
;; mini-buffer messages, which hide my own attempts to provide error
;; reporting. I think this way is better. If a crash happens the
;; system will be inconsistent, but the alternative will be to have
;; the minor-mode switch itself off.
;;
;; 2) The colour list is poor. I would like to improve things here,
;; but I am not sure how. See the comments near the definition of
;; `wide-column-colour-list'
;;
;; 3) Custom support would be good, and no doubt will be added at some
;; time. 
;;
;; 4) It's not going to work if people use lots of different default
;; cursor colours. Seems like a daft thing to do to me! Something to
;; work on anyway. Maybe I could solve this by advicing
;; `set-cursor-colour', but this would fail if someone uses

;;
;;  This minor mode allows functions to operate on the current line if
;;  they would normally operate on a region and region is currently
;;  undefined.
;;
;;  The primary use for this is to kill (cut) the current line if no
;;  region is defined, and kill-region is invoked.  It basically saves
;;  you the effort of going to the begining of the line, selecting the
;;  text up to the end of the line, and killing.  Similarly, when
;;  yanking, it's smart enough to know that the string to be yanked
;;  was killed as a whole line, and it should be yanked as one, too.
;;  So you don't need to position yourself at the start of the line
;;  before yanking.  If region *is* defined, though, all functions act
;;  as normal.
;;
;;  The inspiration for this came from an old editor I used to use
;;  (brief maybe?), that did this exact thing for you.  It was a handy
;;  feature to have, and I definitely wanted it when I moved to Emacs.
;;  I've extended the concept slightly, to let you copy N whole lines,
;;  using the standard prefix method.
;;
;;  NOTE: This package will behave unexpectedly (and indeed is nearly
;;  useless) if `transient-mark-mode' is off, as there is then always
;;  a region defined.
;;
;;  NOTE: I haven't gotten this to work under XEmacs (though I
;;  honestly haven't tried real hard).

;; `whitespace-cleanup' is a handy function, but putting it in

;; Additionally, whitespace preferences are often project-specific, and
;; it's inconvenient to set up `before-save-hook' in a \".dir-locals.el\" file.

;; `whitespace-cleanup-mode' is a minor mode which calls `whitespace-cleanup'

;; was initially clean.

;; Set `whitespace-cleanup-mode' to t in \".dir-locals.el\" to enable the mode
;; project-wide, or add it to the hook for the major mode(s) of your choice.

;; To clean up whitespace everywhere by default, enable
;; `global-whitespace-cleanup-mode'.

;; To clean up whitespace at save even if it was intitially dirty,
;; unset `whitespace-cleanup-mode-only-if-initially-clean'.

;; This mode is built upon some functionality provided by `whitespace-mode', namely
;; `whitespace-action': if you would rather see a warning when saving a file with

;; Websockets clients are created by calling `websocket-open', which
;; returns a `websocket' struct.  Users of this library use the

;; A callback is passed to `websocket-open' that will retrieve
;; websocket frames called from the websocket.  Websockets are
;; eventually closed with `websocket-close'.
;;
;; Server functionality is similar.  A server is started with
;; `websocket-server' called with a port and the callbacks to use,
;; which returns a process.  The process can later be closed with
;; `websocket-server-close'.  A `websocket' struct is also created

"]) (virtualenv . [(20120930 1034) nil "Virtualenv for Python" single ";;; Commentary:

;; This is a minor mode for setting the virtual environment for the

;; python.el. This minor mode was inspired by an earlier
;; implementation by Jesse Legg and Jeremiah Dodds, however this code
;; is a complete re-write with a GPLv3 license consistent with
;; GNU Emacs and python-mode.el.

;; There are two ways to use virtualenv.

;; 1) The quickest way to get started is to simply type:
;;      M-x virtualenv-workon
;;    Which will prompt you to enter the name of a directory in
;;    ~/.virtualenvs that contains your chosen environment. You can
;;    hit tab to show the available completions.

;;    You'll know that you're in virtualenv mode now when you see the
;;    name of the virtualenv you selected in brackets. So if I were to
;;    select my turbogears environment that I call tg2.1 then I would
;;    see [tg2.1] appear in the mode line. To make sure you're new
;;    python shell is set up correctly you can try running this little
;;    snippet of python code:

;;      import os, sys
;;      print os.environ
;;      print sys.path

;; 2) The recommended way to use virtualenv minor mode is to use a

;;
;; Vector-utils is a collection of functions for vector manipulation.

;;
;; Furthermore (when programming in Emacs Lisp), be aware that the
;; modification of a vector is not permitted: only vector *elements*
;; may be changed.  All \"modification\" operations herein can only
;; work by making copies, which is not efficient.
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `vector-utils-depth'

;;     `vector-utils-insert-before'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-after'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-before-pos'
;;     `vector-utils-insert-after-pos'
;;
;; To use vector-utils, place the vector-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'vector-utils)

;; Compare version strings.

;; Similar functionality is available in Emacs; see `version<' and
;; friends defined in `subr.el'.  Unfortunately those functions have
;; some limitations.
;;
;; This library can parse more version strings and doesn't treat
;; certain versions as equal that are not actually equal.

;; What is a valid version string is defined jointly by the regular
;; expression stored in variable `vcomp--regexp' and the function
;; `vcomp--intern' and best explained with an example.
;;
;; Function `vcomp--intern' converts a string to the internal format
;; as follows:
;;
;;   0.11a_rc3-r1 => ((0 11) (97 103 3 1))
;;
;;   0.11         => (0 11)  valid separators are ._-
;;       a        => 97      either 0 or the ascii code of the lower
;;                           case letter (A is equal to a)
;;        _rc     => 103     100 alpha
;;                           101 beta
;;                           102 pre
;;                           103 rc
;;                           104 --
;;                           105 p
;;                           _ is optional, - is also valid
;;           3    => 3       if missing 0 is used
;;            -r1 => 1       there are no variations of -rN
;;
;; A less crazy version string would be converted like this:
;;
;;   1.0.3 => ((1 0 3) (0 104 0 0))
;;
;; The internal format is only intended for ... internal use but if
;; you are wondering why a flat list does not do:
;;
;;   1.97 => (1 97)
;;   1a   => (1 97)

;; There are other ways of dealing with this and similar problems.
;; E.g. the built-in functions treat 1 and 1.0 as equal and only
;; support pre-releases of sorts but not patches (\"-pN\") like this
;; library does.  Having an internal format that doesn't make any
;; compromises but has to be explained seems like the better option.
;;
;; Functions `vcomp-compare' and `vcomp--compare-interned' can be used
;; to compare two versions using any predicate that can compare
;; integers.
;;
;; When comparing two versions whose numeric parts have different
;; lengths `vcomp--compare-interned' fills in -1.
;;
;;   1.0    => ((1 0) ...)   => ((1 0 -1) ...)
;;   1.0.0  => ((1 0 0) ...) => ((1 0  0) ...)
;;
;; So 1.0.0 is greater than 1.0 and 1.0 is greater than 1.  If you
;; don't want that set `vcomp--fill-number' to 0.
;;
;; This filling has to happen in `vcomp--compare-interned' as we don't
;; know the length of the other versions when `vcomp--intern' is called.

;; Function `vcomp-normalize' can be used to normalize a version string.
;;
;;   0-11A-Alpha0-r1 => 0.11a_alpha-r1
;;   2.3d-BETA5      => 2.3d_beta5
;;
;; That's the way I like my version strings; if you would like this to
;; be customizable please let me know.

;; Darcs is David's Advanced Revision Control System at
;; http://www.darcs.net/

;; This version of vc-darcs was written for Emacs 23.  It will work
;; under Emacs 22, albeit with reduced functionality.

;; A few ideas for this file are directly taken from vc-svn.el.  Thanks to
;; Jim Blandy.

;; To install, put this file into your load-path and add the following to
;; your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'vc-handled-backends 'DARCS)
;; (autoload 'vc-darcs-find-file-hook \"vc-darcs\")
;; (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'vc-darcs-find-file-hook)

;; There are a few reasons why vc is difficult to coerce into using darcs
;; as a backend.  By default, vc expects files (not trees) to be versioned
;; as nodes in an AND/OR tree, as is done by RCS and CVS.  Recent version
;; of vc allow some customisation of that, which allows smooth integration
;; with e.g. subversion.

;; Darcs doesn't version files at all; a darcs repository is a collection
;; of patches, and a particular file version is just the set of patches
;; that have been applied in order to build it.  While patches might be
;; reordered when moving between repositories, they usually remain ordered
;; (notable exceptions to that being unpull and optimize); hence,
;; a convenient mental shortcut is to identify a version by the latest
;; patch included in that version.  This is what we do.

;; Internally, darcs identifies a patch by its hash, which you may obtain
;; by using changes --xml.  We follow that approach in this code.  However,
;; as a hash might be difficult to remember at times (it's 65 characters
;; long), all commands that might take an interactive argument also accept
;; a regexp identifying a patch name.  See VC-DARCS-REV-TO-HASH.

;; The fit with vc is still not quite perfect.  A sore point is that vc
;; doesn't normalise versions; hence, if you have a patch called ``Initial
;; import'', you might end up with distinct but identical buffers called
;; vc-darcs.el~Init~, vc-darcs.el~Initial~ and so on.

;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Unicode-whitespace makes the built-in `whitespace-mode' Unicode-aware
;; in two different ways:
;;
;;     1. Recognizing Unicode whitespace characters in your buffer,
;;        such as \"No-Break Space\" or \"Hair Space\".
;;
;;     2. Displaying Unicode characters such as \"Paragraph Sign\"
;;        (pilcrow) in place of whitespace.
;;
;; This library also makes some minor adjustments to the default
;; settings of `whitespace-mode', and exposes character-by-character
;; display substitution mappings in customize.
;;
;; To use unicode-whitespace, place the unicode-whitespace.el library
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs
;; file:
;;
;;     (require 'unicode-whitespace)
;;     (unicode-whitespace-setup 'subdued-faces)  ; 'subdued-faces is optional
;;
;; Then invoke `whitespace-mode' as usual.
;;
;; The display of newlines is changed from the default.  Newlines are
;; not displayed unless one of the following conditions is met:
;;
;;     1. `truncate-lines' is non-nil
;;
;;     2. `word-wrap' is non-nil
;;
;;     3. The major mode of the buffer is listed in
;;        `unicode-whitespace-newline-mark-modes'.
;;
;; A new `whitespace-style' is provided: 'echo causes the name of the
;; whitespace character under the point to be displayed in the echo
;; area.  This is not enabled by default.
;;
;; Two interactive commands are provided to manipulate these settings
;; when `whitespace-mode' is active:
;;
;;     `unicode-whitespace-toggle-newlines'
;;     `unicode-whitespace-toggle-echo'
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET unicode-whitespace RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET whitespace RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     If the extended characters used to represent whitespace do
;;     not display correctly on your system, install unicode-fonts.el
;;     and/or read the setup tips therein.
;;
;;     Be aware when setting customizable variables for `whitespace-mode'
;;     that unicode-whitespace works by overwriting those same variables.
;;
;;     Unicode-whitespace causes alternative line terminators such as

;; Bugs
;;
;;     Gray faces won't look good on a gray background such as that
;;     used by Zenburn color theme.  Does Zenburn set background to
;;     light or dark?  Provide a way to force faces?
;;
;;     The face for alternative line terminators is often incorrect;
;;     font-lock overrides the settings from unicode-whitespace.  This
;;     is because `whitespace-display-char-on' hardcodes \\n as the
;;     line terminator.
;;
;;     Calling alternative line terminators 'space-mark is a hack to
;;     make it possible to toggle display of standard newlines
;;     without affecting the alternates.  They really should all be
;;     called newline-mark.  whitespace.el could be updated to
;;     allow this.
;;
;;     Trailing space that ends with \\r or \\f sometimes does not get
;;     fontified -- though it usually get picked up after some
;;     typing.  This could be because of some assumptions in the
;;     post-command-hook of whitespace.el.
;;
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     There should be separate faces for each of these classes, would
;;     need to patch or override whitespace.el

;;     There are probably more nonprinting characters to include as

;;     gotten from variable `glyphless-char-display'.
;;
;;     Regexps should probably be redone with only \\t for certain
;;     things.
;;
;;     A whitespace-cycle command could turn on the mode and cycle
;;     through a few levels of visibility.
;;
;;     Add a test function that dumps an extended example to scratch
;;     buffer.
;;
;;     Consistent marker symbol for thin spaces, and a way to see the
;;     intersection between thin and nonbreaking - maybe nonbreaking
;;     should be a consistent face and thin a consistent symbol.
;;
;;     The tab-visibility bug in whitespace.el could probably be fixed
;;     with an overlay.  Also, stipple can show tabs as arrows without
;;     changing display, seen here (http://emacswiki.org/emacs/BlankMode).
;;     However, the stipple face is dependent on frame-char-width/height.

;;
;; Explanation:
;;
;; Emacs maintains font mappings on a per-glyph basis, meaning
;; that multiple fonts are used at the same time (transparently) to
;; display any character for which you have a font.  Furthermore,
;; Emacs does this out of the box.
;;
;; However, font mappings via fontsets are a bit difficult to
;; configure.  In addition, the default setup does not always pick
;; the most legible fonts.  As the manual warns, the choice of font
;; actually displayed for a non-ASCII character is \"somewhat random\".
;;
;; The Unicode standard provides a way to organize font mappings: it
;; divides character ranges into logical groups called \"blocks\".  This
;; library configures Emacs in a Unicode-friendly way by providing
;; mappings from
;;
;;     each Unicode block  ---to--->   a font with good coverage
;;
;; and makes the settings available via the customization interface.
;;
;; This library provides font mappings for 205 of the 216 blocks in
;; the Unicode 6.3 standard with displayable characters.
;;
;; To use unicode-fonts, place the unicode-fonts.el file somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'unicode-fonts)
;;     (unicode-fonts-setup)
;;
;; See important notes about startup speed below.
;;
;; To gain any benefit from the library, you must have fonts with good
;; Unicode support installed on your system.  If you are running a
;; recent version of OS X or Microsoft Windows, you already own some
;; good multi-lingual fonts, though you would do very well to download
;; and install the four items below:
;;
;; From http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download
;;
;;     DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono
;;
;; From http://www.quivira-font.com/downloads.php
;;
;;     Quivira
;;
;; From http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/
;;
;;     Symbola
;;
;; Many non-free fonts are referenced by the default settings.
;; However, free alternatives are also given wherever possible, and
;; patches are of course accepted to improve every case.
;;
;; On the assumption that an extended Latin font such as Monaco,
;; Consolas, or DejaVu Sans Mono is already being used for the default
;; face, no separate mappings are provided for the following Unicode
;; blocks:
;;
;;     Latin Extended Additional
;;     Latin Extended-A
;;     Latin-1 Supplement
;;     Spacing Modifier Letters
;;
;; It is also recommended to remove GNU Unifont from your system.
;; Unifont is very useful for debugging, but not useful for reading.
;;
;; The default options favor correctness and completeness over speed,
;; and can add many seconds to startup time in GUI mode.  Note that
;; when possible a font cache is kept between sessions, so try
;; starting Emacs a second time to see the true startup cost.  To
;; further increase startup speed, enter the customization interface
;; and
;;
;;     1. Remove fonts from `unicode-fonts-block-font-mapping'
;;        which are not present on your system.
;;
;;     2. Disable blocks in `unicode-fonts-block-font-mapping'
;;        which you are not interested in displaying.
;;
;; If you are using a language written in Chinese or Arabic script,
;; try customizing `unicode-fonts-skip-font-groups' to control which
;; script you see, and send a friendly bug report.
;;
;; Color Emoji are enabled by default when using the Native Mac port
;; on OS X.  This can be disabled by customizing each relevant mapping,
;; or by turning off all multicolor glyphs here:
;;
;;     M-x customize-variable RET unicode-fonts-skip-font-groups RET

;; Bugs
;;
;;     The default choice of font for each code block balances coverage
;;     versus appearance.  This is necessarily subjective.
;;
;;     Checking for font availability is slow.  This library can
;;     add anywhere between 0.1 - 10 secs to startup time.  It is
;;     slowest under X11.  Some per-architecture limitations are
;;     documented in font-utils.el
;;
;;     Calling `set-fontset-font' can easily crash Emacs.  There is a
;;     workaround, but it may not be sufficient on all platforms.
;;     Tested on Cocoa Emacs, Native Mac Emacs, X11/XQuartz,
;;     MS Windows XP.
;;
;;     Glyph-by-glyph fallthrough happens differently depending on the
;;     font backend.  On Cocoa Emacs, glyph-by-glyph fallthrough does not
;;     occur, and manual per-glyph overrides are required to maximize
;;     coverage.  Fallthrough works on MS Windows, but not perfectly.
;;     X11/FreeType behaves most predictably.
;;
;;     The following ranges cannot be overridden within the
;;     \"fontset-default\" fontset:
;;
;;         Latin Extended Additional
;;         Latin Extended-B
;;         Spacing Modifier Letters
;;
;;     `unicode-fonts-overrides-mapping' shows some order-dependence,
;;     which must indicate a bug in this code.
;;
;;     A number of the entries in `unicode-fonts-overrides-mapping'
;;     are workarounds for the font Monaco, and therefore specific
;;     to OS X.
;;
;;     Widths of alternate fonts do not act as expected on MS Windows.
;;     For example, DejaVu Sans Mono box-drawing characters may use
;;     a different width than the default font.

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'unicode-enbox)
;;
;;     (insert \"\\n\" (unicode-enbox \"testing\"))
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Unicode-enbox.el has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This library provides two functions:
;;
;;     unicode-enbox
;;     unicode-enbox-debox
;;
;; which can be used to add/remove box-drawing characters around
;; a single- or multi-line string.
;;
;; To use unicode-enbox, place the unicode-enbox.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'unicode-enbox)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET unicode-enbox RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; For good monospaced box-drawing characters, it is recommended to
;; install the free DejaVu Sans Mono font and use unicode-fonts.el.
;; If unicode-fonts.el is too heavy for your needs, try adding the
;; following bit to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (set-fontset-font \"fontset-default\"
;;                       (cons (decode-char 'ucs #x2500)  (decode-char 'ucs #x257F))
;;                       '(\"DejaVu Sans Mono\" . \"iso10646-1\"))

;;
;; Emacs has a powerful undo system. Unlike the standard undo/redo system in
;; most software, it allows you to recover *any* past state of a buffer
;; (whereas the standard undo/redo system can lose past states as soon as you
;; redo). However, this power comes at a price: many people find Emacs' undo
;; system confusing and difficult to use, spawning a number of packages that
;; replace it with the less powerful but more intuitive undo/redo system.
;;
;; Both the loss of data with standard undo/redo, and the confusion of Emacs'
;; undo, stem from trying to treat undo history as a linear sequence of
;; changes. It's not. The `undo-tree-mode' provided by this package replaces
;; Emacs' undo system with a system that treats undo history as what it is: a
;; branching tree of changes. This simple idea allows the more intuitive
;; behaviour of the standard undo/redo system to be combined with the power of
;; never losing any history. An added side bonus is that undo history can in
;; some cases be stored more efficiently, allowing more changes to accumulate
;; before Emacs starts discarding history.
;;
;; The only downside to this more advanced yet simpler undo system is that it
;; was inspired by Vim. But, after all, most successful religions steal the
;; best ideas from their competitors!
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; This package has only been tested with Emacs versions 24 and CVS. It should
;; work in Emacs versions 22 and 23 too, but will not work without
;; modifications in earlier versions of Emacs.
;;
;; To install `undo-tree-mode', make sure this file is saved in a directory in
;; your `load-path', and add the line:
;;
;;   (require 'undo-tree)
;;
;; to your .emacs file. Byte-compiling undo-tree.el is recommended (e.g. using
;; \"M-x byte-compile-file\" from within emacs).
;;
;; If you want to replace the standard Emacs' undo system with the
;; `undo-tree-mode' system in all buffers, you can enable it globally by
;; adding:
;;
;;   (global-undo-tree-mode)
;;
;; to your .emacs file.
;;

;;

;;
;;
;; Undo Systems
;; ============
;;
;; To understand the different undo systems, it's easiest to consider an
;; example. Imagine you make a few edits in a buffer. As you edit, you
;; accumulate a history of changes, which we might visualize as a string of
;; past buffer states, growing downwards:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;
;;
;; Now imagine that you undo the last two changes. We can visualize this as
;; rewinding the current state back two steps:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (current buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;;
;; However, this isn't a good representation of what Emacs' undo system
;; does. Instead, it treats the undos as *new* changes to the buffer, and adds
;; them to the history:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (second edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (buffer state before undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (first undo)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (second undo)
;;
;;
;; Actually, since the buffer returns to a previous state after an undo,
;; perhaps a better way to visualize it is to imagine the string of changes
;; turning back on itself:
;;
;;        (initial buffer state)  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                  (first edit)  o  x  (second undo)
;;                                |  |
;;                                |  |
;;                 (second edit)  o  o  (first undo)
;;                                | /
;;                                |/
;;                                o  (buffer state before undo)
;;
;; Treating undos as new changes might seem a strange thing to do. But the
;; advantage becomes clear as soon as we imagine what happens when you edit
;; the buffer again. Since you've undone a couple of changes, new edits will
;; branch off from the buffer state that you've rewound to. Conceptually, it
;; looks like this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\\
;;                                | \\
;;                                o  x  (new edit)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; The standard undo/redo system only lets you go backwards and forwards
;; linearly. So as soon as you make that new edit, it discards the old
;; branch. Emacs' undo just keeps adding changes to the end of the string. So
;; the undo history in the two systems now looks like this:
;;
;;            Undo/Redo:                      Emacs' undo
;;
;;               o                                o
;;               |                                |
;;               |                                |
;;               o                                o  o
;;               .\\                               |  |\\
;;               . \\                              |  | \\
;;               .  x  (new edit)                 o  o  |
;;   (discarded  .                                | /   |
;;     branch)   .                                |/    |
;;               .                                o     |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      |
;;                                                      x  (new edit)
;;
;; Now, what if you change your mind about those undos, and decide you did
;; like those other changes you'd made after all? With the standard undo/redo
;; system, you're lost. There's no way to recover them, because that branch
;; was discarded when you made the new edit.
;;
;; However, in Emacs' undo system, those old buffer states are still there in
;; the undo history. You just have to rewind back through the new edit, and
;; back through the changes made by the undos, until you reach them. Of
;; course, since Emacs treats undos (even undos of undos!) as new changes,
;; you're really weaving backwards and forwards through the history, all the
;; time adding new changes to the end of the string as you go:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |
;;                       o  o     o  (undo new edit)
;;                       |  |\\    |\\
;;                       |  | \\   | \\
;;                       o  o  |  |  o  (undo the undo)
;;                       | /   |  |  |
;;                       |/    |  |  |
;;      (trying to get   o     |  |  x  (undo the undo)
;;       to this state)        | /
;;                             |/
;;                             o
;;
;; So far, this is still reasonably intuitive to use. It doesn't behave so
;; differently to standard undo/redo, except that by going back far enough you
;; can access changes that would be lost in standard undo/redo.
;;
;; However, imagine that after undoing as just described, you decide you
;; actually want to rewind right back to the initial state. If you're lucky,
;; and haven't invoked any command since the last undo, you can just keep on
;; undoing until you get back to the start:
;;
;;      (trying to get   o              x  (got there!)
;;       to this state)  |              |
;;                       |              |
;;                       o  o     o     o  (keep undoing)
;;                       |  |\\    |\\    |

;;                              broke the undo chain)
;;
;; Confused?
;;
;; In practice you can just hold down the undo key until you reach the buffer
;; state that you want. But whatever you do, don't move around in the buffer
;; to *check* that you've got back to where you want! Because you'll break the
;; undo chain, and then you'll have to traverse the entire string of undos
;; again, just to get back to the point at which you broke the
;; chain. Undo-in-region and commands such as `undo-only' help to make using
;; Emacs' undo a little easier, but nonetheless it remains confusing for many
;; people.
;;
;;
;; So what does `undo-tree-mode' do? Remember the diagram we drew to represent
;; the history we've been discussing (make a few edits, undo a couple of them,
;; and edit again)? The diagram that conceptually represented our undo
;; history, before we started discussing specific undo systems? It looked like
;; this:
;;
;;                                o  (initial buffer state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;                                |\\
;;                                | \\
;;                                o  x  (current state)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; Well, that's *exactly* what the undo history looks like to
;; `undo-tree-mode'.  It doesn't discard the old branch (as standard undo/redo
;; does), nor does it treat undos as new changes to be added to the end of a
;; linear string of buffer states (as Emacs' undo does). It just keeps track
;; of the tree of branching changes that make up the entire undo history.
;;
;; If you undo from this point, you'll rewind back up the tree to the previous
;; state:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                x  (undo)
;;                                |\\
;;                                | \\
;;                                o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; If you were to undo again, you'd rewind back to the initial state. If on
;; the other hand you redo the change, you'll end up back at the bottom of the
;; most recent branch:
;;
;;                                o  (undo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here)
;;                                |\\
;;                                | \\
;;                                o  x  (redo takes you here)
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o
;;
;; So far, this is just like the standard undo/redo system. But what if you
;; want to return to a buffer state located on a previous branch of the
;; history? Since `undo-tree-mode' keeps the entire history, you simply need
;; to tell it to switch to a different branch, and then redo the changes you
;; want:
;;
;;                                o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                                o  (start here, but switch
;;                                |\\  to the other branch)
;;                                | \\
;;                        (redo)  o  o
;;                                |
;;                                |
;;                        (redo)  x
;;
;; Now you're on the other branch, if you undo and redo changes you'll stay on
;; that branch, moving up and down through the buffer states located on that
;; branch. Until you decide to switch branches again, of course.
;;
;; Real undo trees might have multiple branches and sub-branches:
;;
;;                                o
;;                            ____|______
;;                           /           \\
;;                          o             o
;;                      ____|__         __|
;;                     /    |  \\       /   \\
;;                    o     o   o     o     x
;;                    |               |
;;                   / \\             / \\
;;                  o   o           o   o
;;
;; Trying to imagine what Emacs' undo would do as you move about such a tree
;; will likely frazzle your brain circuits! But in `undo-tree-mode', you're
;; just moving around this undo history tree. Most of the time, you'll
;; probably only need to stay on the most recent branch, in which case it
;; behaves like standard undo/redo, and is just as simple to understand. But
;; if you ever need to recover a buffer state on a different branch, the
;; possibility of switching between branches and accessing the full undo
;; history is still there.
;;
;;
;;
;; The Undo-Tree Visualizer
;; ========================
;;
;; Actually, it gets better. You don't have to imagine all these tree
;; diagrams, because `undo-tree-mode' includes an undo-tree visualizer which
;; draws them for you! In fact, it draws even better diagrams: it highlights
;; the node representing the current buffer state, it highlights the current
;; branch, and you can toggle the display of time-stamps (by hitting \"t\") and
;; a diff of the undo changes (by hitting \"d\"). (There's one other tiny
;; difference: the visualizer puts the most recent branch on the left rather
;; than the right.)
;;
;; Bring up the undo tree visualizer whenever you want by hitting \"C-x u\".
;;
;; In the visualizer, the usual keys for moving up and down a buffer instead
;; move up and down the undo history tree (e.g. the up and down arrow keys, or
;; \"C-n\" and \"C-p\"). The state of the \"parent\" buffer (the buffer whose undo
;; history you are visualizing) is updated as you move around the undo tree in
;; the visualizer. If you reach a branch point in the visualizer, the usual
;; keys for moving forward and backward in a buffer instead switch branch
;; (e.g. the left and right arrow keys, or \"C-f\" and \"C-b\").
;;
;; Clicking with the mouse on any node in the visualizer will take you
;; directly to that node, resetting the state of the parent buffer to the
;; state represented by that node.
;;
;; You can also select nodes directly using the keyboard, by hitting \"s\" to
;; toggle selection mode. The usual motion keys now allow you to move around
;; the tree without changing the parent buffer. Hitting <enter> will reset the
;; state of the parent buffer to the state represented by the currently
;; selected node.
;;
;; It can be useful to see how long ago the parent buffer was in the state
;; represented by a particular node in the visualizer. Hitting \"t\" in the
;; visualizer toggles the display of time-stamps for all the nodes. (Note
;; that, because of the way `undo-tree-mode' works, these time-stamps may be
;; somewhat later than the true times, especially if it's been a long time
;; since you last undid any changes.)
;;
;; To get some idea of what changes are represented by a given node in the
;; tree, it can be useful to see a diff of the changes. Hit \"d\" in the
;; visualizer to toggle a diff display. This normally displays a diff between
;; the current state and the previous one, i.e. it shows you the changes that
;; will be applied if you undo (move up the tree). However, the diff display
;; really comes into its own in the visualizer's selection mode (see above),
;; where it instead shows a diff between the current state and the currently
;; selected state, i.e. it shows you the changes that will be applied if you
;; reset to the selected state.
;;
;; (Note that the diff is generated by the Emacs `diff' command, and is
;; displayed using `diff-mode'. See the corresponding customization groups if
;; you want to customize the diff display.)
;;
;; Finally, hitting \"q\" will quit the visualizer, leaving the parent buffer in
;; whatever state you ended at. Hitting \"C-q\" will abort the visualizer,
;; returning the parent buffer to whatever state it was originally in when the
;; visualizer was .
;;
;;
;;
;; Undo-in-Region
;; ==============
;;
;; Emacs allows a very useful and powerful method of undoing only selected
;; changes: when a region is active, only changes that affect the text within
;; that region will be undone. With the standard Emacs undo system, changes
;; produced by undoing-in-region naturally get added onto the end of the
;; linear undo history:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |  x  (second undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |
;;                       |  |
;;                       |  o  (first undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |
;;                       | /
;;                       |/
;;                       o
;;
;; You can of course redo these undos-in-region as usual, by undoing the
;; undos:
;;
;;                       o
;;                       |
;;                       |  o_
;;                       o  | \\
;;                       |  |  |
;;                       |  o  o  (undo the undo-in-region)
;;                       o  |  |
;;                       | /   |
;;                       |/    |
;;                       o     x  (undo the undo-in-region)
;;
;;
;; In `undo-tree-mode', undo-in-region works much the same way: when there's
;; an active region, undoing only undoes changes that affect that region. In
;; `undo-tree-mode', redoing when there's an active region similarly only
;; redoes changes that affect that region.
;;
;; However, the way these undo- and redo-in-region changes are recorded in the
;; undo history is quite different. The good news is, you don't need to
;; understand this to use undo- and redo-in-region in `undo-tree-mode' - just
;; go ahead and use them! They'll probably work as you expect. But if you're
;; masochistic enough to want to understand conceptually what's happening to
;; the undo tree as you undo- and redo-in-region, then read on...
;;
;;
;; Undo-in-region creates a new branch in the undo history. The new branch
;; consists of an undo step that undoes some of the changes that affect the
;; current region, and another step that undoes the remaining changes needed
;; to rejoin the previous undo history.

;; Explanation
;;
;; This library provides utilities for manipulating Unicode
;; characters, with integrated ability to return fallback characters
;; when Unicode display is not possible.
;;
;; Some ambiguities in Emacs' built-in Unicode data are resolved, and
;; character support is updated to Unicode 6.3.
;;
;; There are three interactive commands:
;;
;;     `ucs-utils-ucs-insert'       ; `ucs-insert' workalike using ido
;;     `ucs-utils-eval'             ; the inverse of `ucs-insert'
;;     `ucs-utils-install-aliases'  ; install shorter aliases
;;
;; The other functions are only useful from other Lisp code:
;;
;;     `ucs-utils-char'
;;     `ucs-utils-first-existing-char'
;;     `ucs-utils-vector'
;;     `ucs-utils-string'
;;     `ucs-utils-intact-string'
;;     `ucs-utils-pretty-name'
;;     `ucs-utils-read-char-by-name'
;;     `ucs-utils-subst-char-in-region'
;;
;; To use ucs-utils, place the ucs-utils.el library somewhere Emacs
;; can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'ucs-utils)
;;
;; and optionally
;;
;;     (ucs-install-aliases)
;;
;; See Also

"]) (ucs-cmds . [(20131227 204) nil "Macro to create commands that insert Unicode chars." single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This library defines a macro, `ucsc-make-commands', and a command
;;  `ucsc-insert' that can define simple commands that insert Unicode
;;  characters.
;;
;;  Command `ucsc-insert' is a replacement for vanilla command
;;  `insert-char' (called `ucs-insert' prior to Emacs 24), which is
;;  bound by default to `C-x 8 RET' and which lets you type input to
;;  complete against a Unicode character name and then inserts that
;;  character.
;;
;;  The behavior and code of `ucsc-insert' are identical to those of
;;  `insert-char' except for what happens when you use a negative
;;  prefix argument:
;;
;;  1. It acts as if the prefix-arg value was positive.  So a value of
;;     -3 inserts three copies of the character, just as 3 does.
;;
;;  2. In addition to inserting the character, it defines a command
;;     that you can use thereafter to insert that character.  You can
;;     use a prefix argument with that command to insert multiple
;;     copies of the given character.  The command name is the same as
;;     the character name, except it is lowercase and any `SPC'
;;     characters in the character name are replaced by hyphens (`-').
;;
;;  This gives you a command that is tailor-made to insert a given
;;  Unicode character.  You can then bind the command to a key
;;  sequence, effectively adding Unicode characters to your keyboard.
;;
;;  Whenever `insert-char' does anything (it does nothing for a
;;  negative prefix arg), `ucsc-insert' does the same thing.  Because
;;  of this, I recommend that you bind `ucsc-insert' to `C-x 8 RET' as
;;  a replacement for `insert-char'.  Put this in your init file:
;;
;;    (define-key global-map [remap insert-char] 'ucsc-insert)
;;
;;  If you only need a few such commands for inserting particular
;;  Unicode characters, then using `ucsc-insert' to define them is
;;  sufficiently convenient.  But it, like `insert-char', can be a bit
;;  slow if you use completion, because there are many, *MANY*
;;  completion candidates.
;;
;;  As an alternative, you can use macro `ucsc-make-commands' to
;;  quickly create a whole set of such commands for characters whose
;;  names are similar.
;;
;;  You provide a regexp as the macro argument.  It is matched against
;;  all Unicode character names (in `ucs-names').  An insertion
;;  command is created for each of the characters whose name matches.
;;
;;  For example, here are some tests to try.  You need a Unicode font.
;;  One of these fonts might help:
;;
;;   (set-frame-font \"DejaVu Sans Mono-10\")
;;   (set-frame-font \"DejaVu Sans 10\")
;;   (set-frame-font \"Arial Unicode MS\")
;;
;;  Sample command creations:
;;
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"^math\") ; Math symbols
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"latin\") ; Latin alphabet characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"arabic\")
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"^cjk\")  ; Chinese, Japanese, Korean characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"^box drawings \")
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"^greek [a-z]+ letter\") ; Greek characters
;;   (ucsc-make-commands \"\\\\(^hangul\\\\|^circled hangul\\\\|^parenthesized hangul\\\\)\")
;;
;;
;;
;;  Icicles Can Help
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  The commands created using macro `ucsc-make-commands' or the more
;;  general command `ucsc-insert' (or `insert-char') are enhanced if
;;  you use `Icicles'
;;  (http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/icicles.el).
;;
;;  For both, you can use more powerful completion with `Icicles',
;;  including regexp, substring (a subset of regexp), and various
;;  kinds of fuzzy matching.
;;
;;  More importantly, you can use progressive completion, to match
;;  parts of a candidate name in any order.  And you can \"chip away at
;;  the non-elephant\", removing whole sets of candidates that match
;;  patterns that you are *not* interested in.
;;
;;  With `Icicles', `ucsc-insert' (but not the individual insertion
;;  commands defined using it or `ucsc-make-commands') has the
;;  additional advantage that it displays the characters themselves
;;  next to their names, in `*Completions*'.  So you see immediately
;;  what the names represent: WYSIWYG.
;;
;;
;;  Macros defined here:
;;
;;    `ucsc-make-commands'.
;;
;;  Commands defined here:
;;
;;    `ucsc-insert'.

"]) (typo . [(20130323 340) nil "Minor mode for typographic editing" single ";;; Commentary:

;; typo.el includes two modes, `typo-mode` and `typo-global-mode`.
;;
;; `typo-mode` is a buffer-specific minor mode that will change a number
;; of normal keys to make them insert typographically useful unicode
;; characters. Some of those keys can be used repeatedly to cycle through
;; variations. This includes in particular quotation marks and dashes.
;;
;; `typo-global-mode` introduces a global minor mode which adds the
;; `C-c 8` prefix to complement Emacs\342\200\231 default `C-x 8` prefix map.
;;
;; See the documentation of `typo-mode` and `typo-global-mode` for
;; further details.
;;
;; ## Quotation Marks
;;
;; > \342\200\234He said, \342\200\230leave me alone,\342\200\231 and closed the door.\342\200\235
;;
;; All quotation marks in this sentence were added by hitting the \" key
;; exactly once each. typo.el guessed the correct glyphs to use from
;; context. If it gets it wrong, you can just repeat hitting the \" key
;; until you get the quotation mark you wanted.
;;
;; `M-x typo-change-language` lets you change which quotation marks to
;; use. This is also configurable, in case you want to add your own.
;;
;; ## Dashes and Dots
;;
;; The hyphen key will insert a default hyphen-minus glyph. On repeated
;; use, though, it will cycle through the en-dash, em-dash, and a number
;; of other dash-like glyphs available in Unicode. This means that typing
;; two dashes inserts an en-dash and typing three dashes inserts an
;; em-dash, as would be expected. The name of the currently inserted dash
;; is shown in the minibuffer.
;;
;; The full stop key will self-insert as usual. When three dots are
;; inserted in a row, though, they are replaced by a horizontal ellipsis
;; glyph.
;;
;; ## Other Keys
;;
;; Tick and backtick keys insert the appropriate quotation mark as well.
;; The less-than and greater-than signs cycle insert the default glyphs
;; on first use, but cycle through double and single guillemets on
;; repeated use.
;;
;; ## Prefix Map
;;
;; In addition to the above, typo-global-mode also provides a
;; globally-accessible key map under the `C-c 8` prefix (akin to Emacs\342\200\231
;; default `C-x 8` prefix map) to insert various Unicode characters.
;;
;; In particular, `C-c 8 SPC` will insert a no-break space. Continued use
;; of SPC after this will cycle through half a dozen different space
;; types available in Unicode.
;;
;; Check the mode\342\200\231s documentation for more details.

;; Design

;; I was motivated to write this library to support a new backend for
;; Gnus, 'nnttrss.el'. Its design is kept as functional as possible.
;; That means that it makes no use of global state, amongst other
;; things.

;; TODO

;; * Interactive versions of the methods employing global state:
;;   You'll note that there are, in fact, a number of variables defined
;;   at the top-level, namely 'ttrss-address', 'ttrss-user',
;;   'ttrss-password', 'ttrss-sid', 'ttrss-api-level', and
;;   'ttrss-server-version'. These are defined in anticipation of the
;;   next release, in which I plan to introduce interactive counterparts
;;   of most methods that do employ global state.

;; * variable 'nnttrss-debug':
;;   - Trace methods in the mini-buffer
;;   - Keep a log buffer with requests and responses data structures

;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.  Three functions are provided:
;;
;;     `truthy'
;;     `truthy-s'
;;     `truthy-l'
;;
;; Truthy provides an alternative measure of the \"truthiness\" of a
;; value.  Whereas Lisp considers any non-nil value to be \"true\" when
;; evaluating a Boolean condition, `truthy' considers a value to be
;; \"truthy\" if it has *content*.  If the value is a string or buffer,
;; it must have non-zero length.  If a number, it must be non-zero.
;; If a hash, it must have keys.  If a window, it must be live.  See
;; the docstring to `truthy' for more details.
;;
;; `truthy' always returns its argument on success.
;;
;; `truthy-s' is the shallow version of `truthy'.  It does not recurse
;; into sequences, but returns success if any element of a sequence is
;; non-nil.
;;
;; `truthy-l' is the \"lengthwise\" version of `truthy'.  It does not
;; recurse into sequences, but returns success if the argument has
;; length, considering only the variable portion of a data type.
;;
;; To use truthy, place the truthy.el library somewhere Emacs can find
;; it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'truthy)
;;

;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no

;; This is an Emacs minor mode and collection of commands for working with
;; Parenscript code in SLIME and sending it to the browser via Skewer. The goal
;; is to create an environment for hacking Parenscript which fits as naturally
;; as possible into the Lisp style of interactive development.

;; ** Installation

;; Trident is available on MELPA, meaning a simple =M-x package-install RET
;; trident-mode RET= will install both it and its dependencies.

;; To enable MELPA, if you haven't already, add something like the following to
;; your Emacs configuration:

;;   (require 'package)
;;   (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;                '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\") t)
;;   (package-initialize)

;; The dependencies that will be installed are:
;;   - SLIME
;;   - Skewer
;;   - dash.el

;; Trident also requires a Common Lisp implementation and Parenscript.
;; Quicklisp is the best way to install Parenscript.

;; ** Setup

;; To enable trident-mode in a SLIME buffer: M-x trident-mode.

;; To have lisp-mode, slime-mode, and trident-mode all enable automatically for
;; any file with an extension of \".paren\":

;;   (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons \"\\\\.paren\\\\'\" 'lisp-mode))
;;   (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook
;;             #'(lambda ()
;;                 (when (and buffer-file-name
;;                            (string-match-p \"\\\\.paren\\\\>\" buffer-file-name))
;;                   (unless (slime-connected-p)
;;                     (save-excursion (slime)))
;;                   (trident-mode +1))))

;; Parenscript must be loaded in your Common Lisp image, and you'll probably
;; also want to import its symbols:

;;   (ql:quickload :parenscript)
;;   (use-package :parenscript)

;; With the above taken care of it's time to skewer the browser. See Skewer's
;; README for detailed information on the multiple ways you can connect to a
;; site - including sites on servers you don't control.

;; The fastest way to simply try things out is to run M-x run-skewer. Skewer
;; will load an empty page in your browser and connect to it. You can
;; immediately begin using Trident's evaluation commands (described below); to
;; additionally open a JavaScript REPL you can run M-x skewer-repl.

;; ** Commands

;; *** Code expansion commands

;; These commands generate JavaScript from the Parenscript code and display it
;; but don't send it to the browser for evaluation:

;;    - trident-expand-sexp
;;    - trident-expand-last-expression
;;    - trident-expand-defun
;;    - trident-expand-region
;;    - trident-expand-buffer
;;    - trident-expand-dwim

;; From within an expansion buffer you can press e to send the JavaScript to
;; the browser, w to copy it to the kill ring, s to save it to a file (you'll
;; be prompted for the destination) or q to dismiss the buffer. The copy
;; command, w, acts on the region if it's active or the entire buffer
;; otherwise.

;; Additionally, you can use M-x trident-compile-buffer-to-file to expand the
;; current buffer and save the generated code directly to a file.

;; *** Code evaluation commands

;; These commands first compile the Parenscript code to JavaScript and then
;; immediately send to it the browser to be evaluated:

;;    - trident-eval-sexp
;;    - trident-eval-last-expression
;;    - trident-eval-defun
;;    - trident-eval-region
;;    - trident-eval-buffer
;;    - trident-eval-dwim

;; ** Key bindings

;; The traditional set of code evaluation key bindings is a poor fit for
;; Trident,since they would shadow SLIME's equivalent commands and that's
;; probably not what you want. That leaves us without a clear convention to
;; follow, so by default we don't establish any key bindings at all. However,
;; the function trident-add-keys-with-prefix will add two-key key bindings for
;; all commands behind a prefix of your choice.

;; For example: (trident-add-keys-with-prefix \"C-c C-e\"). The key sequence for
;; trident-eval-region is \"e r\", so it's now bound to \"C-c\" \"C-e er\"

;; The full list of key bindings trident-add-keys-with-prefix will establish
;; is:

;;    - \"e RET\" -- trident-eval-sexp
;;    - \"e e\" -- trident-eval-last-expression
;;    - \"e d\" -- trident-eval-defun
;;    - \"e r\" -- trident-eval-region
;;    - \"e b\" -- trident-eval-buffer
;;    - \"e SPC\" -- trident-eval-dwim
;;    - \"x RET\" -- trident-expand-sexp
;;    - \"x e\" -- trident-expand-last-expression
;;    - \"x d\" -- trident-expand-defun
;;    - \"x r\" -- trident-expand-region
;;    - \"x b\" -- trident-expand-buffer
;;    - \"x SPC\" -- trident-expand-dwim

;; Evaluation commands begin with an \"e\", expansion commands with \"x\". The
;; second letter is generally mnemonic but not always. The -sexp commands use
;; RET in correspondence to slime-expand-1, and the -dwim commands use the
;; space bar because it's easy and comfortable to hit.

;; Please consider these keys provisional, and let me know if you have any
;; ideas for improving the arrangement.

;; If you really want to shadow SLIME's key bindings in buffers where
;; trident-mode is active you could do something like this:

;;   (defun steal-slime-keys-for-trident! ()
;;     ;; Don't affect all SLIME buffers, just where invoked
;;     (make-local-variable 'slime-mode-map)
;;     (let ((map slime-mode-map))
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-x C-e\") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-r\") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-M-x\")   nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-k\") nil)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-m\") nil))
;;     (let ((map trident-mode-map))
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-x C-e\") 'trident-eval-last-expression)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-r\") 'trident-eval-region)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-M-x\")   'trident-eval-defun)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-k\") 'trident-eval-buffer)
;;       (define-key map (kbd \"C-c C-m\") 'trident-expand-sexp)))
;;
;;   (add-hook 'trident-mode-hook 'steal-slime-keys-for-trident!)

;; ** Other amenities

;; slime-selector is a great feature and Trident can optionally integrate with
;; it. If you call trident-add-slime-selector-methods, two entries related to
;; trident-mode will be added. One, invoked with p, will take you to the most
;; recently visited buffer where trident-mode is active (excluding buffers
;; which are already visible). The other, on P, will take you to a scratch
;; buffer with trident-mode enabled, creating the buffer if necessary.

;; Speaking of the scratch buffer, the trident-scratch command will take you
;; straight there.

;; ** Still do be done

;;    - Add some tests.
;;    - Better documentation.
;;    - Look into adding a REPL.
;;    - See if more integration with SLIME is possible.
;;    - Command(s) for compiling to a file.
;;    - Similar support for CL-WHO and/or CSS-LITE?
;;    - Add support for Customize.

;; ** Contributing

;; Contributions are very welcome. Since I've just started working on this and
;; don't have everything figured out yet, please first contact me on GitHub or
;; send me an email so we can talk before you start working on something.

;; This code is used to run to functions depending on whether the

;;
;; To install this software place this file and the tmmofl-x.el file
;; into your load path and place
;; 
;; (require 'tmmofl)

;; if your .emacs.
;;
;; To switch on this minor mode use the command tmmofl-mode.  The mode
;; line will indicate that the mode is switched on.  What this actually
;; does will depend on what the main mode of the current buffer
;; is.  The default behaviour is to switch `auto-fill' mode on when
;; point is within comments, and off when its in anything else.
;;

;;; Notes for developers:
;;~/src/ht/home_website/
;; There are actually two ways to use this mode, firstly as a minor
;; mode. Default behaviour is to toggle auto-fill on and off, but you
;; might want additional behaviour. To do this you define a variable called
;; `tmmofl-MODENAME-actions' where mode name is the name for mode as
;; returned by the `major-mode' variable. This variable is as
;; follows...
;;
;;(defvar tmmofl-jde-mode-actions
;;  '(
;;    (font-lock-comment-face
;;     (lambda()
;;       (progn
;;         (abbrev-mode 0)

;;     (lambda()
;;       (abbrev-mode 0))
;;     (lambda()
;;       (abbrev-mode 1)))))
;;
;; This is a list each element of which is a list defining the
;; font-lock-symbol to be acted on, the on function, and the off
;; function. If tmmofl can not find this variable the default of...
;;
;;(defvar tmmofl-default-actions
;;      '(
;;        (font-lock-comment-face
;;         (lambda()
;;           (auto-fill-mode 1))
;;         (lambda()
;;           (auto-fill-mode 0)))))
;;
;; can be used instead, which toggles auto fill on and off when on of
;; off comments. There are some sample action variables defined in
;; tmmofl-x.el which you may load if you wish.
;;
;; The second way to use this mode is outside of the tmmofl minor
;; mode. For instance say you wanted emacs to display the fully
;; referenced name of a class every time you moved point on top of a
;; Type declaration in Java code. If you had a function called
;; `java-show-full-class-name' (which I dont before you ask) you might
;; want to use tmmofl to call this function. To do this you would use
;; the `tmmofl-install-for-mode' function like so...
;;
;;(tmmofl-install-for-mode
;; java-mode-hook
;; font-lock-type-face
;; (lambda()
;;   (java-show-full-class-name))
;; (lambda()
;;   ()))
;;
;; where the first argument is the install hook. This would work
;; without showing the tmmofl mode information in the mode line. I am
;; fairly sure that this should work independantely of `tmmofl-mode'.

;; The software was designed, written and tested on win 95, using
;; NTEmacs. It has since been rewritten on a Gnu/Linux system. Please
;; let me know if it works elsewhere. The current version should be
;; available at http://www.bioinf.man.ac.uk/~lord

;; (joakim@verona.se) who sent me the code which did part of what

;; Provides a simple interface to the HTML Tidy program -- a free
;; utility that can fix common errors in your mark-up and clean up
;; sloppy editing automatically. See
;;
;;       <http://tidy.sourceforge.net/>
;;
;; for more details.  This package provides the following functions:
;;
;;       `tidy-buffer',
;;       `tidy-parse-config-file',
;;       `tidy-save-settings', and
;;       `tidy-describe-options',
;;
;; These can be invoked interactively (using M-x) or via the menu-bar.
;; The function `tidy-buffer' sends the current buffer to HTML Tidy,
;; replacing the existing contents with a \"tidied\" version.  If
;; `tidy-buffer' is given a prefix argument, tidy operates on the
;; current region, ignoring mark-up outside <BODY>...</BODY> tags
;; (useful for writhing cgi scripts in Pearl).  Warnings and errors
;; are presented in a compilation buffer to facilitate tracking down
;; necessary changes (e.g. C-x ` is bound to `next-error').
;;
;; This package also provides menu-bar support for setting Tidy's many
;; options, and includes support for Tidy configuration files.  The
;; function `tidy-parse-config-file' will synchronise options
;; displayed in the menu-bar with the settings in `tidy-config-file'.
;; This is normally called by the load-hook for your HTML editing mode
;; (see installation instructions below).  The function
;; `tidy-save-settings' will save the current option settings to your
;; `tidy-config-file'.  Finally `tidy-describe-options' allows you to
;; browse the documentation strings associated with each option.

;;;

;;;; Installation:

;; This package assumes you have and up-to-date HTML Tidy program
;; installed on your system.  See the URL above for instructions on
;; how to do this.  To set up this support package, first place the
;; \"tidy.el\" file somewhere in your `load-path' and open it in Emacs.
;; Byte-compile and load this package using the command
;;
;; M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load <RET>
;;
;; Next customise the variables `tidy-config-file', `tidy-temp-dir'
;; `tidy-shell-command', `tidy-menu-lock' and `tidy-menu-x-position'
;;
;; M-x customize-group <RET> tidy <RET>
;;
;; Now add the following autoloads to your \".emacs.el\" file:
;;
;; (autoload 'tidy-buffer \"tidy\" \"Run Tidy HTML parser on current buffer\" t)
;; (autoload 'tidy-parse-config-file \"tidy\" \"Parse the `tidy-config-file'\" t)
;; (autoload 'tidy-save-settings \"tidy\" \"Save settings to `tidy-config-file'\" t)
;; (autoload 'tidy-build-menu  \"tidy\" \"Install an options menu for HTML Tidy.\" t)
;;
;; If you use html-mode to edit HTML files then add something like
;; this as well

;; (defun my-html-mode-hook () \"Customize my html-mode.\"
;;   (tidy-build-menu html-mode-map)
;;   (local-set-key [(control c) (control c)] 'tidy-buffer)
;;   (setq sgml-validate-command \"tidy\"))
;;
;; (add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'my-html-mode-hook)

;; This will set up a \"tidy\" menu in the menu bar and bind the key
;; sequence \"C-c C-c\" to `tidy-buffer' in html-mode (normally bound to
;; `validate-buffer').
;;
;; For other modes (like html-helper-mode) simple change the variables
;; `html-mode-hook' and `html-mode-map' to whatever is appropriate e.g.

;; (defun my-html-mode-hook () \"Customize my html-helper-mode.\"
;;   (tidy-build-menu html-helper-mode-map)
;;   (local-set-key [(control c) (control c)] 'tidy-buffer)
;;   (setq sgml-validate-command \"tidy\"))
;;
;; (add-hook 'html-helper-mode-hook 'my-html-mode-hook)

;; Finally, restart Emacs and open an HTML file to test-drive the tidy
;; package. For people new to HTML tidy check that the option \"markup\"
;; under the \"Input/Output\" sub menu is set. You can read the
;; documentation on this option via the menu item \"Describe Options\".
;;
;; Enjoy!

;;;; New Features:
;;
;; 0. Now compatible with CVS version of Tidy as at 22 May 2003
;; 1. Improved menu support to facillitate incorporting new options
;; 2. Menu lock option makes menu stick when toggling options.
;; 3. Now runs on XEmacs!!
;; 4. Uses error file rather than std-error to retrieve errors (this

;; 5. minor bug fix (empty config files)
;; 6. handle buffer modified query in error buffer better
;; 7. make it impossible to mark the error buffer as modified

;;  `iconify-or-deiconify-frame' so that they use thumbnail frames
;;  instead of desktop icons.  To prevent this thumbnail behavior, you
;;  can customize `thumfr-thumbify-dont-iconify-flag' to nil.
;;  Alternatively, you can deactivate (`ad-deactivate') the advice
;;  imposed here on these functions, to restore their original
;;  behavior.
;;
;;  The original behavior of commands `iconify-frame' and
;;  `iconify-or-deiconify-frame' is available using commands
;;  `thumfr-really-iconify-frame' and
;;  `thumfr-really-iconify-or-deiconify-frame'.  In particular, these
;;  commands can be used to iconify even if you bind [iconify-frame]
;;  in `special-event-map' (see below).
;;
;;  You can iconify or deiconify all thumbnail frames (that is, only
;;  the thumbnail frames), to get them out of the way and bring them
;;  back.  Use commands `thumfr-iconify-thumbnail-frames' and
;;  `thumfr-deiconify-thumbnail-frames' to do this.
;;
;;  Emacs built-in function `raise-frame' is redefined here to also
;;  dethumbify.  The original behavior of `raise-frame' is available
;;  in command `thumfr-only-raise-frame'.
;;
;;  You can cycle among the visible frames in two ways, applying
;;  `thumfr-fisheye' to each in turn.  The first way is using commands
;;  `thumfr-fisheye-previous-frame' and `thumfr-fisheye-next-frame'
;;  (which you can bind to, for instance, `C-M-prior' and `C-m-next').
;;  The second way is using command `thumfr-doremi-thumbnail-frames+'
;;  plus the arrow keys or mouse wheel.
;;
;;  To be able to use `thumfr-doremi-thumbnail-frames+', you need
;;  library `doremi-frm.el' (which in turn requires libraries
;;  `hexrgb.el', `faces+.el', `doremi.el', and perhaps `ring+.el',
;;  depending on your Emacs version).  The only libraries strictly
;;  required by `thumb-frm.el' are `frame-fns.el' and `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;  A more comprehensive, lower-level way of substituting thumbifying
;;  for iconifying is to do the following in your init file:
;;
;;    (define-key special-event-map [iconify-frame]
;;                'thumfr-thumbify-frame-upon-event)
;;
;;  In effect, this thumbifies any frame as soon as it is iconified,
;;  no matter how it was iconified.  In particular, this will let you
;;  use the window-manager \"minimize\" frame button (usually at the
;;  upper left or right frame corner) to thumbify.
;;
;;  Be aware of this fact/feature, which is true of any binding on
;;  keymap `special-event-map': The event interrupts any key sequence
;;  in progress, to invoke its command, and then the key sequence as a
;;  whole is processed, ignoring the special event.
;;
;;  For example, assuming that event `iconify-frame' occurs whenever
;;  you use a window-manager button (e.g. in the title bar) or menu
;;  item to minimize (iconify) a frame, if you do `C-x
;;  <click-the-minimize-button> b', then: (1) as soon as you click the
;;  minimize button the frame is thumbified, and (2) when you hit `b'
;;  the key sequence `C-x b' is processed (e.g. `switch-to-buffer'
;;  prompts you for a buffer name).  I mention this not because it is
;;  a useful feature but in order to avoid confusion.
;;
;;  If you do bind `thumfr-thumbify-frame-upon-event' to
;;  `iconify-frame', be aware that `thumfr-thumbify-dont-iconify-flag'
;;  will no longer have any effect: Emacs will *always* thumbify
;;  instead of iconify (except for functions `really-iconify-*frame',
;;  which are designed to counter this).  If you try this behavior and
;;  then wish to cancel it, to once again allow iconification, use
;;  this code:
;;
;;  In Emacs 20 or prior:
;;    (define-key special-event-map [iconify-frame] 'ignore-event)
;;
;;  In Emacs 21 or later:
;;    (define-key special-event-map [iconify-frame] 'ignore)
;;
;;
;;  Other user options (variables) not mentioned above are these:
;;
;;    `thumfr-font-difference'             - Zoom of thumbnail frames.
;;    `thumfr-rename-when-thumbify-flag'   - Rename frame to buffer.
;;    `thumfr-stack-display-edge'         - Display edge for stacking.
;;    `window-mgr-title-bar-pixel-width'   - Thickness of title bar.
;;
;;
;;  IMPORTANT:
;;
;;    Thumbnail frames are *FULLY FUNCTIONAL*.  In particular, their
;;    buffers are *NOT* read-only in any way.  You can edit their
;;    buffers normally, even if you can't see what you're doing :-).
;;
;;    You can also scroll and search their buffers.  You can thumbify
;;    the frame of a progressive output buffer, to monitor the output
;;    from 4,000 meters as it is produced.  In other words, you can
;;    interactive with thumbnail frames in the usual ways.  They are

;;
;;
;;  How To Use This Library
;;  =======================
;;
;;  End Users
;;  ---------
;;
;;  Load this library after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `thingatpt.el'.  You can put this in your init file (`~/.emacs'):
;;
;;    (eval-after-load \"thingatpt\"
;;      '(require 'thingatpt+))
;;
;;  That defines new functions and improved versions of some of the
;;  standard thing-at-point functions.  All such functions have the
;;  prefix `tap-', so they are not used by default in any way.
;;
;;  That does not at all, however, make Emacs use the improved
;;  functions.  Merely loading this library does not change the
;;  behavior of thing-at-point features.
;;
;;  If you want functions defined here to be used for calls to
;;  standard Emacs functions that make use of the `thing-at-point' and
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' symbol properties for standard thing
;;  types (e.g. `list'), then put this in your init file, instead:
;;
;;    (eval-after-load \"thingatpt\"
;;      '(when (require 'thingatpt+)
;;         (tap-put-thing-at-point-props))
;;
;;  A further step, which I recommend, is to use the `tap-' versions
;;  of standard functions, defined here, everywhere in place of those
;;  standard functions.  In other words, redefine the standard
;;  functions as the `tap-' versions defined here.  For example,
;;  redefine `bounds-of-thing-at-point' to do what
;;  `tap-bounds-of-thing-at-point' does.
;;
;;  (If you do that then you need not invoke
;;  `tap-put-thing-at-point-props', since the property values set by
;;  vanilla library `thingatpt.el' will be OK because the functions
;;  themselves will have been redefined in that case.)
;;
;;  So to get the most out of this library, I recommend that you put
;;  (only) the following in your init file:
;;
;;    (eval-after-load \"thingatpt\"
;;      '(when (require 'thingatpt+)
;;         (tap-redefine-std-fns))
;;
;;  That makes all Emacs code that uses the following standard
;;  functions use the their versions that are defined here, not the
;;  vanilla versions defined in `thingatpt.el'.
;;
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' - Better behavior.
;;                               Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `form-at-point'            - Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `list-at-point'            - Better behavior.
;;  `symbol-at-point'          - Use `emacs-lisp-mode-syntax-table'.
;;  `thing-at-point'           - Ensure it returns a string or nil.
;;                               Accept optional arg SYNTAX-TABLE.
;;  `thing-at-point-bounds-of-list-at-point'
;;                             - Better behavior.  Accept optional
;;                               args UP and UNQUOTEDP.
;;
;;
;;  Lisp Programmers
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  If you write code that uses some of the functions defined here,
;;  this section is for you.
;;
;;  You can use the functions defined in `thingatpt+.el' that have
;;  prefix `tap-' to obtain, for your code, the improvements they
;;  provide.  Doing only that has no effect on any code that calls
;;  vanilla thing-at-point functions (which have no prefix `tap-').
;;
;;  For convenience you can invoke `tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix' to
;;  provide alias functions that have the same names but without the
;;  prefix `tap-'.  This affects only functions defined here that have
;;  no vanilla counterpart, so the aliases do not collide with any
;;  standard Emacs functions.  This is just a naming convenience.
;;
;;  For example, you might do this:
;;
;;    (when (require 'thingatpt+ nil t)  ; (no error if not found)
;;      (tap-define-aliases-wo-prefix))
;;
;;  You can optionally enable the improvements defined here to have
;;  wider application, so that code that does not directly invoke the
;;  functions defined here nevertheless uses them indirectly.
;;
;;  You can, for example, put `tap-' functions on THING-type symbols
;;  as property `thing-at-point' or property
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.  That has the effect of using those
;;  `tap-' functions for those THING types only.
;;
;;  For example, to get the improvements for lists offered by
;;  `tap-list-at-point', you can do this:
;;
;;    (put 'list 'bounds-of-thing-at-point
;;         'tap-bounds-of-list-at-point)
;;    (put 'list 'thing-at-point 'tap-list-at-point)
;;
;;  That causes the vanilla thing-at-point functions to invoke those
;;  `tap-' functions when handling lists.  It has an effect only on
;;  lists, not on other THINGs.  This behavior happens because the
;;  generic vanilla functions `thing-at-point' and
;;  `bounds-of-thing-at-point' use those standard symbol properties.
;;
;;  For even wider application, that is, if you want all of the
;;  improvements defined here to be available generally, then you will
;;  also need to do ONE of the following (#1 or #2):
;;
;;  1. Call `tap-redefine-std-fns', to redefine standard functions.
;;
;;  2. Do BOTH of these things:
;;
;;    a. Call `tap-put-thing-at-point-props', to substitute `tap-'
;;       functions for standard functions as the values of symbol
;;       properties `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
;;
;;    b. Call the individual `tap-*' functions explicitly for each of
;;       the standard functions that would be redefined by
;;       `tap-redefine-std-fns'.  Or call standard functions that make
;;       use of property `thing-at-point' or
;;       `bounds-of-thing-at-point'.
;;
;;    This (#2) changes (improves) the behavior of things like
;;    (thing-at-point 'list), even though it does not redefine any
;;    standard functions.  Again, this is because functions
;;    `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point' use symbol
;;    properties `thing-at-point' and `bounds-of-thing-at-point', and
;;    `tap-put-thing-at-point-props' changes those property values.

;; eg:

;;

;; Given a location and day/night color themes, this file provides a
;; `change-theme` function that selects the appropriate theme based on
;; whether it is day or night. It will continue to change themes at
;; sunrise and sunset. To install:

;; Set the location:
;;     (setq calendar-location-name \"Dallas, TX\") 
;;     (setq calendar-latitude 32.85)
;;     (setq calendar-longitude -96.85)

;; Specify the day and night themes:
;;     (require 'theme-changer)
;;     (change-theme 'solarized-light 'solarized-dark)

;; You can also pass nil as either of parameters to change-theme, with the
;; effect of not using a theme (or using the default Emacs theme) during that
;; period of the day. For example:

;;     (change-theme nil 'solarized-dark)

;; will result in setting the default Emacs theme during the day, and
;; solarized-dark during the night.

;; You may need to add this file path to your loadpath. For example:
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path \"~/.emacs.d/elisp/theme-changer\")

;; If you want to use the color-theme package instead of the Emacs 24 color
;; theme facility:
;;     (setq theme-changer-mode \"color-theme\")

;; A \"project\" in textmate-mode is determined by the presence of
;; a .git directory, an .hg directory, a Rakefile, or a Makefile.

;; You can configure what makes a project root by appending a file
;; or directory name onto the `*textmate-project-roots*' list.

;; If no project root indicator is found in your current directory,
;; textmate-mode will traverse upwards until one (or none) is found.
;; The directory housing the project root indicator (e.g. a .git or .hg
;; directory) is presumed to be the project's root.

;; In other words, calling Go to File from
;; ~/Projects/fieldrunners/app/views/towers/show.html.erb will use
;; ~/Projects/fieldrunners/ as the root if ~/Projects/fieldrunners/.git

;;
;; Transform LaTeX encoded non-ASCII characters to and from their
;; visible (utf-8) representations when visiting a file and preserve
;; their original encoding when saving the buffer.
;;
;; TeX/LaTeX documents often contain special characters that are not
;; available in ASCII code in a special command form. For example, the
;; German umlaut \303\244 can be written in LaTeX as {\\\"a}, \\\"{a}, \\\"a or
;; even \"a. Of course, nowadays one should use an encoding like utf-8,
;; which contain a natural representation of these characters.
;; Unfortunately, old documents may still use the old encodings or
;; non-ASCII encodings are not allowed for other reasons. Emacs can
;; already automatically encode and decode such characters from and to
;; their LaTeX representation using the `iso-cvt' package: during
;; editing the document the characters are utf-8 encoded but when
;; saved to disk the characters are transformed to a LaTeX
;; representation.
;;
;; Unfortunately, this an all-or-nothing approach: either all
;; characters are transformed or none. But when working on a document
;; with several authors this may be problematic. This may particularly
;; true if the document is stored in a revision control system. In
;; these cases each author may use its own editor, each editor may
;; have its own setting and encodes umlauts in a special preferred
;; way. Each time one author does a small change, *all* umlauts in the
;; whole document may get transformed. This may also lead to huge
;; diffs that consist of many hunks that only change the encoding of
;; some characters.
;;
;; The purpose of `tex-smart-umlauts' is to automatically encode and
;; decode umlauts from and to their tex representation, while
;; *preserving* the original encoding. In other words, when a LaTeX
;; file is visited, the original encoding of each character is saved
;; and the character is transformed to its visible (utf-8)
;; representation. When the document is saved again, each character
;; that has been present when the document has been loaded is saved in
;; its *original* encoding. Only newly inserted non-ASCII characters
;; get a new encoding that depends on the user-options of
;; `tex-smart-umlauts'. This way, a small change in a document will
;; not reencode all non-ASCII charactes as `iso-cvt' would do and only
;; the modified parts of the document will really be modified on disk.

;; A collection of paredit-like functions for editing in html-mode.

;; ## Installation
;;
;; I highly recommended installing tagedit through elpa.
;;
;; It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
;; [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):
;;
;;     M-x package-install tagedit
;;
;; You can also install the dependencies on your own, and just dump
;; tagedit in your path somewhere:
;;
;;  - <a href=\"https://github.com/magnars/s.el\">s.el</a>
;;  - <a href=\"https://github.com/magnars/dash.el\">dash.el</a>

;; ## Functions
;;
;; This is it at the moment:
;;
;;  - `tagedit-forward-slurp-tag` moves the next sibling into this tag.
;;  - `tagedit-forward-barf-tag` moves the last child out of this tag.
;;  - `tagedit-raise-tag` replaces the parent tag with this tag.
;;  - `tagedit-splice-tag` replaces the parent tag with its contents.
;;  - `tagedit-kill` kills to the end of the line, while preserving the structure.
;;
;; Not part of paredit:
;;
;;  - `tagedit-kill-attribute` kills the html attribute at point.

;; ## Setup
;;
;; If you want tagedit to bind to the same keys as paredit, there's this:
;;
;; ```cl
;; (eval-after-load \"sgml-mode\"
;;   '(progn
;;      (require 'tagedit)
;;      (tagedit-add-paredit-like-keybindings)
;;      (add-hook 'html-mode-hook (lambda () (tagedit-mode 1)))))
;; ```
;;
;; Or you can cherry-pick functions and bind them however you want:
;;
;; ```cl
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"C-<right>\") 'tagedit-forward-slurp-tag)
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"C-<left>\") 'tagedit-forward-barf-tag)
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"M-r\") 'tagedit-raise-tag)
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"M-s\") 'tagedit-splice-tag)
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"C-k\") 'tagedit-kill)
;; (define-key tagedit-mode-map (kbd \"s-k\") 'tagedit-kill-attribute)
;; ```

;; ## Experimental tag editing
;;
;; I am currently working on automatically updating the closing tag when
;; you edit the starting tag. It is an experimental feature, since it is quite new
;; and I'm sure it breaks some things.
;;
;; This also inserts `<></>` when you type `<`, and expands it to
;; `<div></div>` as you type.
;;
;; You can turn on experimental features using:
;;
;; ```cl
;; (tagedit-add-experimental-features)
;; ```

;; ## Other conveniences
;;
;; It also expands one-line tags into multi-line tags for you, when you
;; press refill-paragraph. Like this:
;;
;; ```html
;; <p>My one very long text inside a tag that I'd like to refill</p>
;; ```
;;
;; then after `M-q`:
;;
;; ```html
;; <p>
;;   My one very long text inside a tag that
;;   I'd like to refill
;; </p>
;; ```
;;
;; You can disable this behavior by setting
;; `tagedit-expand-one-line-tags` to nil.

;; 
;; * Introduction
;; Tabbar ruler is an emacs package that allows both the tabbar and the
;; ruler to be used together.  In addition it allows auto-hiding of the
;; menu-bar and tool-bar.
;; 
;; 
;; Tabbar appearance based on reverse engineering Aquaemacs code and
;; changing to my preferences, and Emacs Wiki.
;; 
;; Tabbar/Ruler integration is new. Tabbar should be active on mouse
;; move.  Ruler should be active on self-insert commands.
;; 
;; Also allows auto-hiding of toolbar and menu.
;; 
;; To use this, put the library in your load path and use
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq tabbar-ruler-global-tabbar t) ; If you want tabbar
;;   (setq tabbar-ruler-global-ruler t) ; if you want a global ruler
;;   (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-menu t) ; If you want a popup menu.
;;   (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-toolbar t) ; If you want a popup toolbar
;;   (setq tabbar-ruler-popup-scrollbar t) ; If you want to only show the
;;                                         ; scroll bar when your mouse is moving.
;;   (require 'tabbar-ruler)
;;   
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; * Changing how tabbar groups files/buffers
;; The default behavior for tabbar-ruler is to group the tabs by frame.
;; You can change this back to the old-behavior by:
;; 
;;   (tabbar-ruler-group-buffer-groups)
;; 
;; or by issuing the following code:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq tabbar-buffer-groups-function 'tabbar-buffer-groups)
;; 
;; 
;; In addition, you can also group by projectile project easily by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (tabbar-ruler-group-by-projectile-project)
;; 
;; * Adding key-bindings to tabbar-ruler
;; You can add key-bindings to change the current tab.  The easiest way
;; to add the bindings is to add a key like:
;; 
;; 
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c t\") 'tabbar-ruler-move)
;; 
;; 
;; After that, all you would need to press is Control+c t and then the
;; arrow keys will allow you to change the buffer quite easily.  To exit
;; the buffer movement you can press enter or space.
;; 
;; * Known issues
;; the left arrow is text instead of an image.

;; Explanation
;;
;; This library offers absolutely no functionality!  The following
;; macros are provided as synonyms for `progn':
;;
;;     `then'
;;     `else'
;;     `protected'
;;     `unwind'
;;
;; These macros can be used to clarify `if' or `unwind-protect' forms.
;;
;; Note that as synonyms for `progn', these forms have no useful
;; effects, and no additional syntax check is done, so nothing
;; prevents you from writing obfuscatory expressions such as
;;
;;     (if t (else 1) (then 2))      ; same as (if t (progn 1) (progn 2))
;;
;; or idiotic expressions such as
;;
;;     (if t
;;         (protected 1)
;;       (unwind 2))
;;
;; So, think of these macros as glorified comments.  And realize that
;; if you are tempted to use them, if in fact you have even read the
;; documentation to this point, you are hopelessly impure at heart.
;;
;; To use syntactic-sugar, place the syntactic-sugar.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'syntactic-sugar)

;;
;;  Look up synonyms for a word or phrase in a thesaurus.
;;
;;
;;  Getting Started
;;  ---------------
;;
;;  To use library Synonyms, you will need the Moby Thesaurus II file,
;;  `mthesaur.txt', available here:
;;
;;    ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext02/mthes10.zip
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    ;; The file names are absolute, not relative, locations
;;    ;;     - e.g. /foobar/mthesaur.txt.cache, not mthesaur.txt.cache
;;    (setq synonyms-file        <name & location of mthesaur.txt>)
;;    (setq synonyms-cache-file  <name & location of your cache file>)
;;    (require 'synonyms)
;;
;;  As an alternative to the first two lines, you can use Customize to
;;  set `synonyms-file' and `synonyms-cache-file' persistently.  The
;;  second of these files is created by this library, to serve as a
;;  synonym cache for completion.
;;
;;  The main command is `synonyms'.  It prompts you for a word or
;;  phrase to look up in the thesaurus.  The synonyms found are then
;;  displayed in buffer *Synonyms*.  For example, `M-x synonyms RET
;;  democracy' displays synonyms for `democracy'.
;;
;;  If you do not define `synonyms-file' and `synonyms-cache-file'
;;  prior to using command `synonyms', that command will prompt you to
;;  define them.  If you want to use the same values during subsequent
;;  Emacs sessions, then you should use `M-x customize-option' to save
;;  those newly defined values.
;;
;;
;;  Some Definitions
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  The thesaurus is divided into \"entries\", which are like glossary
;;  entries: each entry is followed by associated words and phrases,
;;  which, for lack of a better word, I refer to as \"synonyms\".  For
;;  example, `democracy' is an entry, and it is followed by its
;;  synonyms.  Some synonyms are not also entries.  For example,
;;  `patriarchy' is in the thesaurus as a synonym but not as an entry.
;;
;;  Note: What I call \"synonyms\" here are not necessarily synonyms, in
;;  the sense of having the same or even similar meanings.  They are
;;  simply terms collected together with the same thesaurus entry
;;  because they are related in some way - the grouping is what
;;  defines their relation.
;;
;;  In Moby Thesaurus II, the meanings of synonyms in the same group
;;  do have something in common, but this might be simply the fact
;;  that they are terms of a similar kind.  For example, the
;;  \"synonyms\" following the `democracy' thesaurus entry are words
;;  such as `dictatorship' and `autocracy'.  These are different forms
;;  of the same general thing: government - they are certainly not
;;  synonymous with each other or with the entry `democracy'.
;;
;;
;;  Searching the Thesaurus
;;  -----------------------
;;
;;  The default input value for command `synonyms' is the word under
;;  the cursor.  Alternatively, if a region is active and you are in
;;  Transient Mark mode (recommended), then it is the text in the
;;  region (selection).
;;
;;  Your input is actually treated as a regular expression (regexp),
;;  so you can also input patterns like `for.*ion', which will match
;;  thesaurus entries `formation', `formulation', `fornication',
;;  `fortification', and `forward motion'.  Note that the last of
;;  these is a phrase rather than a single word.
;;
;;  Using a regexp as input is a powerful way to search, but be aware
;;  that it can be costly in CPU time and computer memory if the
;;  regexp is not appropriate.  The regexp `.*' will, for example,
;;  likely use up available memory before being able to return the
;;  entire thesaurus (it's very large).  You can always use `C-g' to
;;  interrupt a thesaurus search if you mistakenly use an inefficient
;;  regexp.
;;
;;
;;  Using a Prefix Argument To Do More
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  You can use a prefix argument to modify searching and the
;;  presentation of search results, as follows:
;;
;;    `C-u'     - Search for additional synonyms, in two senses:
;;
;;                1) Return also synonyms that are matched partially
;;                   by the input.
;;
;;                2) Search the entire thesaurus for input matches,
;;                   even if the input matches a thesaurus entry.
;;
;;    `M--'     - Append the search results to any previous search
;;                results, in buffer *Synonyms*.  (Normally, the new
;;                results replace any previous results.)
;;
;;    `C-u C-u' - `C-u' plus `M--': Search more and append results.
;;
;;  If you find yourself often using a particular prefix argument (for
;;  example, to append results), then you might want to instead change
;;  the default behavior to reflect this preference.  Options
;;  `synonyms-match-more-flag' and `synonyms-append-result-flag'
;;  correspond to using `C-u' and `M--', respectively.  In fact, a
;;  prefix argument simply toggles the value of the corresponding
;;  option for the duration of the command.  So, for example, if
;;  `synonyms-append-result-flag' is t and you use `M--', then results
;;  will not be appended.
;;
;;  When partially matching input (`C-u', sense #1), complete synonyms
;;  are matched against your input.  This means that you generally
;;  need not add a preceding or trailing `.*' to try to match a
;;  complete synonym.  For example, input `format' will match the
;;  complete synonyms `conformation', `efformation', `format',
;;  `formation', `formative', `formational', `information',
;;  `informative', `informational', `malformation', `deformation',
;;  `reformation', `transformation', `reformatory', and so on - there
;;  is no need to input `.*format.*' to match the same synonyms.
;;
;;  To better understand the meaning of #2 above for `C-u' (to
;;  continue the search even if your input matches an entry), try, for
;;  example, `C-u M-x synonyms RET widespread'.  You'll see not only
;;  the main synonyms listed for `widespread' as an entry, but also
;;  lots of different meanings of `widespread', judging by the entries
;;  for which it is listed as a synonym:
;;
;;    `accepted', `ample', `broad', `broadcast', `capacious',
;;    `catholic', `commodious', `commonness', `conventional',
;;    `currency', `current', `customary', `deep', `deltoid',
;;    `diffuse', `discrete', `dispersed', `disseminated',
;;    `dissipated', `distributed', `epidemic', `established',
;;    `everyday', `expansive', `extended', `extensive', `familiar',
;;    `fan shaped', `far flung', `far reaching', `flaring', `full',
;;    `general', `indiscriminate', `infinite', `large scale',
;;    `liberal', `normal', `normality', `open', `ordinary',
;;    `outstretched', `pervasive', `popular', `prescribed',
;;    `prescriptive', `prevailing', `prevalence', `prevalent',
;;    `public', `rampant', `received', `regnant', `regular',
;;    `regulation', `reign', `rife', `roomy', `ruling', `run',
;;    `scattered', `set', spacious`', `sparse', `splay', `sporadic',
;;    `sprawling', `spread', `standard', `stock', `straggling',
;;    `stretched out', `sweeping', `time-honored', `traditional',
;;    `universal', `usual', `vast', `voluminous', `wholesale', `wide
;;    open', `wide', and `wonted'.
;;
;;  These are just the entries! Each of these is of course followed by
;;  its own synonyms - perhaps 100 or 300, including `widespread'.
;;
;;  This list of entries is not the same list as the synonyms for
;;  entry `widespread'.  There are words and phrases here that are not
;;  in the latter list, and vice versa.  For example, the former (but
;;  not the latter) list includes `full'; the latter (but not the
;;  former) list includes `wide-reaching'.
;;
;;  The latter are the words most closely related to `widespread'.
;;  The list above are the other thesaurus entries (corresponding to
;;  main categories) to which `widespread' is most closely related.
;;  Looking at all of the synonym groups in which `widespread' appears
;;  can tell you additional information about its meanings - and it
;;  can provide additional synonyms for `widespread'.
;;
;;
;;  Using Completion with Synonyms
;;  ------------------------------
;;
;;  You can complete words and phrases in the minibuffer, as input to
;;  command `synonyms'.  You can use library Synonyms together with
;;  library `Icicles to complete a partial word in a text buffer into a
;;  word or phrase in the thesaurus.  If you use both libraries then
;;  load Icicles after Synonyms.  For more information on Icicles, see
;;  `http://www.emacswiki.org/Icicles'.
;;
;;  ** Minibuffer Input Completion **
;;
;;  You can enter any text to match against thesaurus synonyms.  When
;;  you are prompted by command `synonyms' to enter this text, you can
;;  also use input completion to complete to a thesaurus synonym.
;;  That is, even though you can enter any text (including a regexp),
;;  completion will only complete to synonyms in the thesaurus.
;;
;;  If you load library Icicles, then a more powerful version of
;;  command `synonyms' is used.  In particular, it lets you:
;;
;;   - Use `S-TAB' during completion to see the list of all synonyms
;;     (thesaurus terms) that match your minibuffer input so far.
;;
;;   - Use `next' (or repeated `S-TAB'), and `prior' (usually keys
;;     `Page Down' and `Page Up') during completion to cycle through
;;     the completion candidates (synonyms) that match your input.
;;
;;   - Use `C-next' and `C-prior' during completion to display the
;;     synonyms of the current completion candidate.
;;
;;  ** Completing Buffer Text Using the Thesaurus **
;;
;;  Icicles also provides two commands for using completion to insert
;;  thesaurus entries in a buffer:
;;
;;   - `icicle-complete-thesaurus-entry' completes a word in a text
;;     buffer to any word or phrase in the thesaurus.  I bind it to
;;     `C-c /'.
;;
;;   - `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry' inserts thesaurus words and
;;     phrases in a text buffer.  It is a multi-command, which means
;;     that, within a single call to it, you can insert any number of
;;     thesaurus entries, in succession.  If you want to, you can
;;     write an entire book using a single call to
;;     `icicle-insert-thesaurus-entry'!
;;
;;
;;  Browsing the Thesaurus
;;  ----------------------
;;
;;  Besides using command `synonyms' to search for synonyms, you can
;;  use Synonyms to browse the thesaurus.  This is really just the
;;  same thing, but key and mouse bindings are provided in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, so you need not input anything - just point and click
;;  the hyperlinks.  Buffer *Synonyms* is in Synonyms major mode,
;;  which provides a few additional features.
;;
;;  You can still choose to search for additional synonyms or append
;;  search results, without bothering with a prefix argument, by using
;;  modifier keys (Control, Meta) with a mouse click.
;;
;;  Another way of browsing is to revisit previous search-result
;;  pages.  You can do this using commands `synonyms-history-backward'
;;  and `synonyms-history-forward'.  In buffer *Synonyms*, these are
;;  bound to the following key sequences, for convenience:
;;
;;    `l', `p', `mouse-4' - `synonyms-history-backward'
;;    `r', `n', `mouse-5' - `synonyms-history-forward'
;;
;;  The `l' and `r' bindings correspond to the history bindings in
;;  Info.  The `p' and `n' bindings stand for \"previous\" and \"next\".
;;  The bindings to additional mouse buttons correspond to typical
;;  bindings for Back and Forward in Web browsers.
;;
;;  In addition to these bindings, the same history commands can be
;;  accessed by clicking links [Back] and [Forward] with `mouse-2'.
;;
;;  If you have previously used the append option (via, for example,
;;  `M-mouse2'), so that there are multiple search results in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, then using a history command simply takes you to the
;;  preceding (for [Back]) or following (for [Forward]) result in the
;;  buffer, measured from the current cursor position.  Depending on
;;  the cursor position, this might be different from the previous or
;;  next search made previously.
;;
;;  This is for convenience, but it is also more efficient in the case
;;  of a regexp search that takes a long time.  Except for this
;;  special treatment of appended results, whenever you navigate the
;;  search-results history you are actually searching again for a
;;  synonym you sought previously.  The case of appended results is
;;  analogous to accessing a Web browser cache when navigating the
;;  history.
;;
;;  You can of course use modifier keys (Control, Meta) while you
;;  click links [Back] and [Forward], to impose their usual behavior:
;;  search for additional synonyms or append search results, or both.
;;
;;  Finally, some people prefer menus, so there is a Synonyms menu-bar
;;  menu when you are in Synonyms mode, complete with all of the
;;  functionalities described above.
;;
;;  For more information on the browsing possibilities in buffer
;;  *Synonyms*, use `?' in Synonyms mode.
;;
;;
;;  Dictionary Definitions, Antonyms, etc.
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Synonyms works with a large but simple database of groups of words
;;  and phrases that are synonyms of each other.  This database does
;;  not provide definitions of words or phrases; it simply groups
;;  them.  Command `synonym-definition' (aka `dictionary-definition')
;;  lets you look up a word or phrase (or a regexp) using one or more
;;  dictionaries on the Web.  That is usually the best source for this
;;  kind of information, but you obviously need an Internet connection
;;  to use this command.
;;
;;  Options (variables) `synonyms-dictionary-url' and
;;  `synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' are URLs you can set to point
;;  to the dictionaries of your choice.  The default value of
;;  `synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' looks up the search term in
;;  multiple dictionaries, and it lets you use wildcards.  Use `C-h v
;;  synonyms-dictionary-alternate-url' for more information.  The
;;  default value of `synonyms-dictionary-url' usually provides a
;;  quicker answer.  Both of these URLs also give you access to
;;  additional information about the search term (antonyms, etymology,
;;  even pronunciation).
;;
;;  In buffer *Synonyms*, you can simply hit `d' followed by `RET' or
;;  `mouse-2' to look up a term that is in the buffer.  Just as for
;;  looking up a synonym by clicking `mouse-2', if you select text
;;  (region), then that text is looked up.
;;
;;
;;  A Cache File of Synonyms
;;  ------------------------
;;
;;  The very first time you use Synonyms, a large list of synonyms
;;  will be compiled and written to a cache file.  This is slow - it
;;  takes 2-3 minutes - but it is only a one-time cost.  From then on,
;;  whenever you first use Synonyms during an Emacs session, the cache
;;  file will be read (quickly), to create the list of synonyms that
;;  are used for minibuffer completion.
;;
;;
;;  Using Other Thesauri, Dictionaries, and so on - CSV data
;;  --------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There is nothing in library Synonyms that ties it to the Moby
;;  Thesaurus II thesaurus.  All of its functionality will work with
;;  any file of comma-separated values.  Each line of such a file is
;;  interpreted as a synonym group, as understood here, and the first
;;  word or phrase on each line is interpreted as a thesaurus entry,
;;  as understood here.  This means only that search results are
;;  organized into sections with entry headers.
;;
;;  If, for example, you had a CSV file of personal contacts, where
;;  the first term in each line was a last name or a company name,
;;  then you could use library Synonyms to query it, producing the
;;  same kind of output as for the thesaurus.
;;
;;  One thing to keep in mind if you try to use library Synonyms with
;;  a different CSV file is that there are several different CSV-file
;;  syntaxes.  The one that Synonyms is built to use is a simple one,
;;  with no quote marks around entries and no embedded quote marks
;;  within entries.
;;
;;  Similarly, there is nothing here that limits the functionality to
;;  English.  If you had a thesaurus in another language, it should
;;  work as well.
;;
;;  Currently, Synonyms works with a single raw synonyms file
;;  (thesaurus) and a corresponding single cache file (for
;;  completion).  However, it would be easy to extend the
;;  functionality to use multiple thesauri or, in general, multiple
;;  CSV files.  Suggestions of requirements (e.g. ways to select a
;;  thesaurus for particular passages of text) are welcome.

;;  Acknowledgements
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  The basic functionality provided here was derived from library
;;  `mthesaur.el', by Tad Ashlock <taashlo@cyberdude.com>.  That
;;  library, in turn, was inspired by library `thesaurus.el', by Ray
;;  Nickson.  Thanks also to those who sent helpful bug reports.
;;
;;
;;  Note on MS Windows Emacs 20 and Cygwin `grep'
;;  ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There is apparently a bug in the Emacs (at least versions 20-22) C
;;  code that implements function `call-process' on MS Windows.  When
;;  using native Windows Emacs with Cygwin commands, such as `grep',
;;  the C code removes a level of backslashes in some cases, so string
;;  arguments supplied to `call-process' need to have twice as many
;;  backslashes as they should need in those cases.  It is for this
;;  reason that option `synonyms-use-cygwin-flag' is supplied here.
;;  When that option is non-nil, backslashes in regexps are hacked to
;;  do the right thing.  (In Emacs 20, this means doubling the
;;  backslashes; in Emacs 21-22, this means doubling them unless there
;;  are spaces in the search string.)
;;
;;
;;  Maybe To Do?
;;  ------------
;;
;;  1. It would be ideal to have not only synonym information but also
;;     definitions, antonyms, more general and more specific terms,
;;     filtering by part of speech (verb vs adjective etc.), and so
;;     on.  A good example of what I'd really like to have is provided
;;     by the free Windows program WordWeb (available here:
;;     http://wordweb.info/).  Combining that functionality with
;;     Icicles completion features would provide a great tool, IMO.
;;
;;     `synonyms-definition*' goes a long way toward providing this,
;;     and perhaps it is the best way to go, since there is so much
;;     more definitional info on the Web.

;; This package provides the commands `swbuff-switch-to-next-buffer'
;; and `swbuff-switch-to-previous-buffer' to respectively switch to
;; the next or previous buffer in the buffer list.
;;
;; The `swbuff-exclude-buffer-regexps' defines a list of regular
;; expressions for excluded buffers.  The default setting excludes
;; buffers whose name begin with a blank character.  To exclude all the
;; internal buffers (that is *scratch*, *Message*, etc...) you could
;; use the following regexps '(\"^ .*\" \"^\\\\*.*\\\\*\").
;;
;; Switching buffers pops-up a status window at the bottom of the
;; selected window.  The status window shows the list of switchable
;; buffers where the switched one is hilighted using
;; `swbuff-current-buffer-face'.  This window is automatically
;; discarded after any command is executed or after the delay
;; specified by `swbuff-clear-delay'.
;;
;; The bufferlist is sorted by how recently the buffers were used.  If
;; you prefer a fixed (cyclic) order set `swbuff-recent-buffers-first'
;; to nil.
;;
;; When the status window disappears because of the clear-delay you
;; still stay in switching mode.  The timeout is only a visual
;; thing.  If you want it to have the same effect as using the buffer,

;; 2. [Optional] bind se/make-summary-buffer to your favorite key

;;    (define-key help-map \"M\" 'se/make-summary-buffer)
;;    NOTE: You can use summarye from menu (Tools->Make summary) or
;;    M-x se/make-summary-buffer 
;; 3. Invoke it. You will get the summary buffer of current buffer. You
;;    will use it easily, I think.
;; 4. If you want to specify the item pattern, set the value to buffer-local
;;    variable se/item-delimiter-regexp like the following examples. The
;;    value must be either a regular expression string or a list of a list
;;    of a tag string and a regexp string. See examples.
;; 5. And if you want to specify the displayed string in summary buffer,
;;    assign a function to buffer-local variable
;;    se/item-name-constructor-function.

;; Coding memo:
;; * While cluster is an internal structure which index starts from
;;   zero, item means objects user can view like a displayed line or
;;   the corresponding text. Thus every commands do not have cluster
;;   in their names.
;; * In this program, term `face' is used. But it means not face but overlay.

;; Explanation
;;
;; String-utils is a collection of functions for string manipulation.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `string-utils-stringify-anything'
;;     `string-utils-has-darkspace-p'
;;     `string-utils-has-whitespace-p'
;;     `string-utils-trim-whitespace'
;;     `string-utils-compress-whitespace'
;;     `string-utils-string-repeat'
;;     `string-utils-escape-double-quotes'
;;     `string-utils-quotemeta'
;;     `string-utils-pad'
;;     `string-utils-pad-list'
;;     `string-utils-propertize-fillin'
;;     `string-utils-plural-ending'
;;     `string-utils-squeeze-filename'
;;     `string-utils-squeeze-url'
;;     `string-utils-split'
;;     `string-utils-truncate-to'
;;
;; To use string-utils, place the string-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'string-utils)
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements

;;     GNU Emacs version 24.4-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.2           : yes, with some limitations
;;     GNU Emacs version 21.x and lower : unknown

;;     (string-utils-stringify-anything (symbol-function 'string-utils-test-func))
;;
;;     Some objects such as window-configuration are completely

;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Stringification of autoload data type
;;         http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Autoload-Type.html
;;
;;     Maybe args should not be included when stringifying lambdas and
;;     macros.
;;
;;     In string-utils-propertize-fillin, strip properties which are
;;     set to nil at start, which will create more contiguity in the
;;     result.  See this example, where the first two characters have
;;     the same properties
;;
;;         (let ((text \"text\"))
;;           (add-text-properties 0 1 '(face nil) text)
;;           (add-text-properties 2 3 '(face error) text)
;;           (string-utils-propertize-fillin text 'face 'highlight)
;;           text)
;;
;;      String-utils-squeeze-url needs improvement, sometimes using
;;      two elisions where one would do.

[(20130210 1515) nil "Insert snippets of text into a buffer" single ";;; Commentary:

;; A quick stab at providing a simple template facility like the one
;; present in TextMate (an OSX editor).  The general idea is that a
;; snippet of text (called a template) is inserted into a buffer
;; (perhaps triggered by an abbrev), and while the point is within the
;; snippet, a special keymap is active to permit the user to cycle the
;; point to any of the defined fields (placeholders) within the
;; template via `snippet-next-field' and `snippet-prev-field'.

;; For example, the following template might be a useful while editing
;; HTML:

;;   <a href=\"$$\">$$</a>

;; This template might be useful for python developers.  In this
;; example, reasonable defaults have been supplied:

;;   for $${element} in $${sequence}:
;;       match = $${regexp}.search($${element})

;; When a template is inserted into a buffer (could be triggered by an
;; abbrev expansion, or simply bound to some key), point is moved to
;; the first field denoted by the \"$$\" characters (configurable via
;; `snippet-field-identifier').  The optional default for a field is
;; specified by the \"{default}\" (the delimiters are configurable via
;; `snippet-field-default-beg-char' and `snippet-field-defaul-end-char'.

;; If present, the default will be inserted and highlighted.  The user
;; then has the option of accepting the default by simply tabbing over
;; to the next field (any other key bound to `snippet-next-field' in
;; `snippet-map' can be used).  Alternatively, the user can start
;; typing their own value for the field which will cause the default
;; to be immediately replaced with the user's own input.  If two or
;; more fields have the same default value, they are linked together
;; (changing one will change the other dynamically as you type).

;; `snippet-next-field' (bound to <tab> by default) moves the point to
;; the next field.  `snippet-prev-field' (bound to <S-tab> by default)
;; moves the point to the previous field.  When the snippet has been
;; completed, the user simply tabs past the last field which causes
;; the snippet to revert to plain text in a buffer.  The idea is that
;; snippets should get out of a user's way as soon as they have been
;; filled and completed.

;; After tabbing past all of the fields, point is moved to the end of
;; the snippet, unless the user has specified a place within the
;; template with the `snippet-exit-identifier' (\"$.\" by default).  For
;; example: 

;;   if ($${test} {
;;       $.
;;   }

;; Indentation can be controlled on a per line basis by including the
;; `snippet-indent' string within the template.  Most often one would
;; include this at the beginning of a line; however, there are times
;; when indentation is better performed in other parts of the line.
;; The following shows how to use the functionality:

;;   if ($${test}) {
;;   $>this line would be indented
;;   this line will be indented after being inserted$>
;;   }

;;
;; Overview
;; ========
;;
;; This library provides minor mode `smooth-scroll-mode' which adds
;; smooth scrolling feature to Emacs.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLING
;; ==========
;; To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
;; `load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
;; load-path RET\" within Emacs), then add the following line to your
;; .emacs startup file:
;;
;;    (require 'smooth-scroll)
;;    (smooth-scroll-mode t)
;;
;;
;; USING
;; =====
;; To toggle smooth scrolling feature, just type:
;;
;;   `M-x smooth-scroll-mode RET'
;;
;; while smooth scrolling feature is enabled, the string \"SScr\" will
;; be displayed on mode line.
;;
;; Also check out the customization group
;;
;;   `M-x customize-group RET smooth-scroll RET'
;;
;;
;; Additional commands provided by `smooth-scroll.el'.
;; ===================================================
;;
;; This library provides commands that brings `in place scrolling'
;; feature, listed below:
;;
;;    `scroll-up-1'
;;    `scroll-down-1'
;;    `scroll-left-1'
;;    `scroll-right-1'
;;
;; Bind these commands to any key you like for your convenience.
;;
;;    Keymap example:
;;
;;      (global-set-key [(control  down)]  'scroll-up-1)
;;      (global-set-key [(control  up)]    'scroll-down-1)
;;      (global-set-key [(control  left)]  'scroll-right-1)
;;      (global-set-key [(control  right)] 'scroll-left-1)
;;
;;      NOTE: Keys described above won't work on non window-system.
;;
;;
;; KNOWN PROBLEMS
;; ==============
;; - The speed of smooth scrolling is very slow on `Carbon Emacs'
;;   and `Cocoa Emacs' on Mac OS X. If you want to use smooth scrolling
;;   feature comfortably on these Emacsen, set large number
;;   (e.g. 4, 6 or 8) to the variable `smooth-scroll/vscroll-step-size' 
;;   and `smooth-scroll/hscroll-step-size'.
;;
;; - `scroll-left-1' and `scroll-right-1' may not work properly
;;   when the `smooth-scroll-mode' is turned off, due to the behavior
;;   of original `scroll-left' and `scroll-right' functions.

;; This code comes from my article \"Effective Editing I: Movement\"

;;
;; Smart Scan lets you jump between symbols in your buffer, based on

;; search. Incremental calls will still respect the original search
;; query so you can move up or down in your buffer, quickly, to find
;; other matches without having to resort to `isearch' to find things
;; first. The main advantage over isearch is speed: Smart Scan will
;; guess the symbol point is on and immediately find other symbols
;; matching it, in an unintrusive way.

;; INSTALLATION

;; Install package
;; (package-install 'smartscan)

;; Enable minor mode in a specific mode hook using

;; or globally using
;; (global-smartscan-mode 1)

;;
;; It is derived from <http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SmartTabs>
;; with modifications by the various authors listed above.
;;
;; Modification history is at <https://github.com/jcsalomon/smarttabs>.

;;; Installation:

;; The easiest and preferred way to install smart-tabs-mode is to use
;; the package available on MELPA.
;;
;; Manual installation:
;;
;; Save smart-tabs-mode.el to a a directory on your load-path
;; (e.g., ~/.emacs.d/elisp), then add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;  (autoload 'smart-tabs-mode \"smart-tabs-mode\"

;;  (autoload 'smart-tabs-advice \"smart-tabs-mode\")
;;  (autoload 'smart-tabs-insinuate \"smart-tabs-mode\")
;;

;;; Enabling smart-tabs-mode within language modes:

;; As of version 1.0 of this package, the easiest and preferred way to
;; enable smart-tabs-mode is with the smart-tabs-insinuate function;
;; for example,
;;
;;  (smart-tabs-insinuate 'c 'c++ 'java 'javascript 'cperl 'python
;;                        'ruby 'nxml)
;;
;; will enable smart-tabs-mode with all supported language modes.
;;
;; (See below for instructions on adding additional language support.)
;;
;; The old method of manually enabling smart-tabs-mode is still
;; available, but is no longer recommended; smart-tabs-insinuate
;; wraps the functionality below in a convenient manner.
;;
;; For reference, the basic manual method looks like this:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'MODE-HOOK 'smart-tabs-mode-enable)
;;  (smart-tabs-advice INDENT-FUNC TAB-WIDTH-VAR)
;;
;; Note that it might be preferable to delay calling smart-tabs-advice
;; until after the major mode is loaded and evaluated, so the lines
;; above would be better written like this:
;;
;;  (add-hook 'MODE-HOOK (lambda ()
;;                         (smart-tabs-mode-enable)
;;                         (smart-tabs-advice INDENT-FUNC TAB-WIDTH-VAR)))

;; Here are some specific examples for a few popular languages:
;;
;;  ;; C
;;  (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'smart-tabs-mode-enable)
;;  (smart-tabs-advice c-indent-line c-basic-offset)

;;  ;; Python
;;  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook 'smart-tabs-mode-enable)
;;  (smart-tabs-advice python-indent-line-1 python-indent)

;;; Adding language support

;; Language support can be added through the use of the macro
;; `smart-tabs-add-language-support'. Pass in the symbol you wish
;; to use to identify the language, the mode hook, and a list
;; of cons cells containing (indent-line-function . offset-variable).
;; For example, if C++ mode was not provided by default it could be
;; added as follows:
;;
;; (smart-tabs-add-language-support c++ c++-mode-hook
;;   ((c-indent-line . c-basic-offset)

;;
;; Smart Mode Line is a sexy mode-line for Emacs, that aims to be easy to
;; read from small to large monitors by using a *prefix feature* and
;; *smart truncation*.
;;
;; Installation
;; ===
;; Make sure \"smart-mode-line.el\" is in your load path, then place
;; this code in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (setq sml/theme 'dark)
;;     (require 'smart-mode-line)
;;     (sml/setup)
;;
;; Features
;; ===
;; Its main features include:
;;
;;  1. **Color coded**:
;;     Highlights the most important information for you
;;     (buffer name, modified state, line number). Don't
;;     like the colors? See item 5)!
;;
;;  2. **Fixed width** (if you want):
;;     Lets you set a maxium width for the path name and mode names, and
;;     truncates them intelligently (truncates the directory, not the
;;     buffer name). Also let's you **right indent** strings in the
;;     mode-line (see `sml/mode-width').
;;
;;  3. **Directory as Prefixes**:
;;     Prefix feature saves a LOT of space. e.g. \"~/.emacs.d/\"
;;     is translated to \":ED:\" in the path (open a file inside
;;     this folder to see it in action). Long path names you
;;     are commmonly working on are displayed as short
;;     abbreviations. Set your own prefixes to make best use
;;     of it (by configuring `sml/replacer-regexp-list'). Mousing
;;     over the abbreviated path will show you the full
;;     path. See below for examples.
;;
;;  4. **Hide minor-modes**:__
;;     Hidden-modes feature saves even more space. Select
;;     which minor modes you don't want to see listed by
;;     customizing the `sml/hidden-modes' variable. This will
;;     filter out the modes you don't care about and unclutter
;;     the modes list (mousing over the modes list still shows
;;     the full list).
;;
;;  5. **Very easy to configure**:
;;     All colors and variables are customizable. You can change the
;;     whole theme with `sml/apply-theme', or just customize anything
;;     manually with `sml/customize' and `sml/customize-faces'. There are
;;     *DOZENS* of variables to customize your mode-line, just pop over
;;     there and have a look!
;;
;;  6. **Compatible with absolutely anything**:
;;     I'm serious. Versions 2.0 and above should be compatible with
;;     **any** other packages that display information in the mode-line
;;     (evil, nyan-mode, elscreen, display-battery-mode, etc). If you
;;     find *ANYTHING* that does not appear as it should, file a bug report
;;     and I'll get to it.
;;
;; Important Variables:
;; ===
;; All variables can be edited by running `sml/customize', and the
;; documentations are mostly self explanatory, I list here only the
;; most important ones.
;;
;;  1. `sml/shorten-directory' and `sml/shorten-modes'
;;   Choose what theme ou want to use for the mode-line colors. For now
;;   there are 3 different themes: `dark', `light', and `respectful'.
;;
;;  1. `sml/shorten-directory' and `sml/shorten-modes'
;;   Setting both of these to `t' garantees a fixed width mode-line
;;   (directory name and minor-modes list will be truncated to fit). To
;;   actually define the width, see below.
;;
;;  2. `sml/name-width' and `sml/mode-width'
;;   Customize these according to the width of your emacs frame. I set
;;   them to `40' and `full' respectively, and the mode-line fits
;;   perfectly when the frame is split in two even on my laptop's small
;;   17\" monitor. `full' means everything after the minor-modes will be
;;   right-indented.

;;  3. `sml/replacer-regexp-list'
;;   This variable is a list of (REGEXP REPLACEMENT) that is used
;;   to parse the path. The replacements are applied
;;   sequentially. This allows you to greatly abbreviate the path
;;   that's shown in the mode-line. If this abbreviation is of
;;   the form \":SOMETHING:\", it is considered a prefix and get's
;;   a different color (you can change what's considered a prefix
;;   by customizing `sml/prefix-regexp').
;;   For example, if you do a lot of work on a folder called
;;   \"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/\" almost half the
;;   mode-line would be occupied just by the folder name, which
;;   is much less important than the buffer name. But, you can't
;;   just hide the folder name, since editting a file in
;;   \"~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/Source\" is VERY different
;;   from editting a file in \"~/Dropbox/Projects/Source\". By
;;   setting up a prefix for your commonly used folders, you get
;;   all that information without wasting all that space. In this
;;   example you could set the replacement to \":ProjDev:\" or just
;;   \":InDev:\", so the path shown in the mode-line will be
;;   \":ProjDev:Source/\" (saves a lot of space without hiding
;;   information).
;;
;; Here go some more useful examples:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^~/Dropbox/Projects/In-Development/\" \":ProjDev:\"))
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^~/Documents/Work/\" \":Work:\"))
;;
;;     ;; Added in the right order, they even work sequentially:
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^:DB:Documents\" \":DDocs:\"))
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^~/Dropbox/\" \":DB:\"))
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^:Git:\\\\(.*\\\\)/src/main/java/\" \":G/\\\\1/SMJ:\"))
;;     (add-to-list 'sml/replacer-regexp-list '(\"^~/Git-Projects/\" \":Git:\"))

;; Quickstart
;;

;;
;;     (simpleclip-mode 1)
;;
;;     ;; Press super-c to copy without affecting the kill ring.
;;     ;; Press super-x or super-v to cut or paste.
;;     ;; On OS X, use \342\214\230-c, \342\214\230-v, \342\214\230-x.
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; By default, Emacs orchestrates a subtle interaction between the
;; internal kill ring and the external system clipboard.
;;
;; `simpleclip-mode' radically simplifies clipboard handling: the
;; system clipboard and the Emacs kill ring are made completely
;; independent, and never influence each other.
;;
;; `simpleclip-mode' also enables support for accessing the system
;; clipboard from a TTY where possible.  You will likely need to
;; set up custom keybindings if you want to take advantage of that.
;;
;; To use simpleclip, place the simpleclip.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'simpleclip)
;;     (simpleclip-mode 1)
;;
;; Keybindings
;;
;; Turning on `simpleclip-mode' activates clipboard-oriented key
;; bindings which are modifiable in customize.
;;
;; The default bindings override keystrokes which may be bound as
;; alternatives for kill/yank commands on your system.  \"Traditional\"
;; kill/yank keys (control-k, control-y, meta-y) are unaffected.
;;
;; The default keybindings are
;;
;;              super-c   simpleclip-copy
;;              super-x   simpleclip-cut
;;              super-v   simpleclip-paste
;;
;;     control-<insert>   simpleclip-copy
;;       shift-<delete>   simpleclip-cut
;;       shift-<insert>   simpleclip-paste
;;
;; The \"super\" keybindings are friendly for OS X.  The \"insert\"/\"delete\"
;; keybindings are better suited for Unix and MS Windows.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET simpleclip RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; `x-select-enable-primary' is not affected by `simpleclip-mode'.
;;
;; Access to the system clipboard from a TTY is provided for those
;; cases where a literal paste is needed -- for example, where
;; autopair interferes with pasted input which is interpreted as
;; keystrokes.  If you are already happy with the copy/paste provided
;; by your terminal emulator, then you don't need to set up
;; simpleclip's TTY support.
;;
;; The following functions may be useful to call from Lisp:
;;
;;     `simpleclip-get-contents'
;;     `simpleclip-set-contents'

;; Use `httpd-start' to start the web server. Files are served from
;; `httpd-root' on port `httpd-port' using `httpd-ip-family' at host
;; `httpd-host'. While the root can be changed at any time, the server
;; needs to be restarted in order for a port change to take effect.

;; Everything is performed by servlets, including serving
;; files. Servlets are enabled by setting `httpd-servlets' to true
;; (default). Servlets are four-parameter functions that begin with
;; \"httpd/\" where the trailing component specifies the initial path on
;; the server. For example, the function `httpd/hello-world' will be
;; called for the request \"/hello-world\" and \"/hello-world/foo\".

;; The default servlet `httpd/' is the one that serves files from
;; `httpd-root' and can be turned off through redefinition or setting
;; `httpd-serve-files' to nil. It is used even when `httpd-servlets'
;; is nil.

;; The four parameters for a servlet are process, URI path, GET/POST
;; arguments (alist), and the full request object (header
;; alist). These are ordered by general importance so that some can be
;; ignored. Two macros are provided to help with writing servlets.

;;  * `with-httpd-buffer' -- Creates a temporary buffer that is
;;    automatically served to the client at the end of the body.
;;    Additionally, `standard-output' is set to this output
;;    buffer. For example, this servlet says hello,

;;     (defun httpd/hello-world (proc path &rest args)
;;       (with-httpd-buffer proc \"text/plain\"
;;         (insert \"hello, \" (file-name-nondirectory path))))

;; This servlet be viewed at http://localhost:8080/hello-world/Emacs

;; * `defservlet' -- Similar to the above macro but totally hides the
;;   process object from the servlet itself. The above servlet can be
;;   re-written identically like so,

;;     (defservlet hello-world text/plain (path)
;;       (insert \"hello, \" (file-name-nondirectory path)))

;; Note that `defservlet' automatically sets `httpd-current-proc'. See
;; below.

;; The \"function parameters\" part can be left empty or contain up to
;; three parameters corresponding to the final three servlet
;; parameters. For example, a servlet that shows *scratch* and doesn't
;; need parameters,

;;     (defservlet scratch text/plain ()
;;       (insert-buffer-substring (get-buffer-create \"*scratch*\")))

;; A higher level macro `defservlet*' wraps this lower-level
;; `defservlet' macro, automatically binding variables to components
;; of the request. For example, this binds parts of the request path
;; and one query parameter. Request components not provided by the
;; client are bound to nil.

;;     (defservlet* packages/:package/:version text/plain (verbose)
;;       (insert (format \"%s\\n%s\\n\" package version))
;;       (princ (get-description package version))
;;       (when verbose
;;         (insert (format \"%S\" (get-dependencies package version)))))

;; It would be accessed like so,

;;     http://example.com/packages/foobar/1.0?verbose=1

;; Some support functions are available for servlets for more
;; customized responses.

;;   * `httpd-send-file'   -- serve a file with proper caching
;;   * `httpd-redirect'    -- redirect the browser to another url
;;   * `httpd-send-header' -- send custom headers
;;   * `httpd-error'       -- report an error to the client
;;   * `httpd-log'         -- log an object to *httpd*

;; Some of these functions require a process object, which isn't
;; passed to `defservlet' servlets. Use t in place of the process
;; argument to use `httpd-current-proc' (like `standard-output').

;; If you just need to serve static from some location under some
;; route on the server, use `httpd-def-file-servlet'. It expands into
;; a `defservlet' that serves files.

;;
;; DESCRIPTION AND USAGE
;;
;; Show CSS is a minor mode for emacs.
;;
;; With showcss-mode turned on, as you navigate around an HTML file the
;; matching css for that element will be displayed in another buffer.
;;
;; In the current html buffer, if you move the cursor over a class=\".*?\"
;; or id=\".*?\" a buffer will open with the external css file loaded and
;; scrolled to the matching selector.
;;
;; Show Css will look at the <link> tags and a custom comment tag to get
;; the location of external css files.
;;
;; Show Css looks for a comment with this regex:
;; <!-- showcss: \\\\(.*?\\\\) -->
;;
;; For example:
;; <!-- showcss: /home/user/projects/facebook/site/css/main.css -->
;; or
;; <!-- showcss: ./sass_files/main.sass-->
;;
;; The comment is useful if you want to use sass files directly instead
;; of compiling them.  Also showcss-mode will only use local files.  So
;; if you use css on a remote server, you will need to use the showcss
;; tag in you html file and have it point to a local copy of that css.
;;
;; INSTALLATION

"]) (shorten . [(20131201 620) nil "component-wise string shortener" single ";;; Commentary:

;; This is a component-wise string shortener, meaning that, given a list
;; of strings, it breaks each string into parts, then computes shortest
;; prefix of each part with respect to others of the same 'depth', such
;; that when joined back together, the shortened form of the whole string
;; remains unique within the resulting list.  Many styles of shortening
;; are made possible via three functions that the caller may provide: the
;; split function, the join function, and the validate-component function.
;;
;; Strings are broken with the value of `shorten-split-function' (a
;; procedure string->list), and shortened components are rejoined with the
;; value of `shorten-join-function' (a procedure list->string[*]).  The
;; default split and join functions break the string on word boundaries,
;; and rejoin on the empty string.  Potential shortened forms of
;; components are tested with `shorten-validate-component-function'; its
;; default value passes only if its argument contains at least one
;; word-constituent character (regexp \\w), meaning that by default,
;; components consisting entirely of non-word characters will not be
;; shortened, and components that start with non-word characters will only
;; be shortened so much that they have at least one word-constituent
;; character in them.
;;
;; The main entry point is `shorten-strings', which takes a list of strings
;; as its argument and returns an alist ((STRING . SHORTENED-STRING) ...).
;;
;; [*] Also takes a second argument; see docstring of
;; `shorten-join-function'.

;;     does a `yank-pop' or a `yank-pop-secondary', as appropriate.
;;
;;     (If you use `browse-kill-ring+.el', load `second-sel.el'
;;     first.)
;;
;;  2. Use Icicles (library `icicles.el').
;;
;;     If you do that then the behavior is similar to that provided by
;;     `browse-kill-ring+.el', except that `M-y' at the top level lets
;;     you choose a selection from either ring using completion
;;     against the ring entries.  And during completion you can use
;;     `S-delete' to delete entries from the ring.
;;
;;     (This is the case by default, but you can customize Icicles to
;;     not do this by removing the `M-y' binding, if, for example, you
;;     prefer the `browse-kill-ring+.el' behavior to completing.

;;;   Note: the completion uses a somewhat less common style than

;; Ruby refactor is inspired by the Vim plugin vim-refactoring-ruby,
;; currently found at https://github.com/ecomba/vim-ruby-refactoring.

;; I've implemented 5 refactorings
;;  - Extract to Method
;;  - Extract Local Variable
;;  - Extract Constant
;;  - Add Parameter
;;  - Extract to Let

; ## Install
;; Add this file to your load path.
;; (require 'ruby-refactor)  ; if not installed from a package
;; (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'ruby-refactor-mode-launch)

;; ## Extract to Method:
;; Select a region of text and invoke 'ruby-refactor-extract-to-method'.
;; You'll be prompted for a method name. The method will be created
;; above the method you are in with the method contents being the
;; selected region. The region will be replaced w/ a call to method.

;; ## Extract Local Variable:
;; Select a region of text and invoke `ruby-refactor-extract-local-variable`.
;; You'll be prompted for a variable name.  The new variable will
;; be created directly above the selected region and the region
;; will be replaced with the variable.

;; ## Extract Constant:
;; Select a region of text and invoke `ruby-refactor-extract-contant`.
;; You'll be prompted for a constant name.  The new constant will
;; be created at the top of the enclosing class or module directly
;; after any include or extend statements and the regions will be
;; replaced with the constant.

;; ## Add Parameter:
;; 'ruby-refactor-add-parameter'
;; This simply prompts you for a parameter to add to the current
;; method definition. If you are on a text, you can just hit enter
;; as it will use it by default. There is a custom variable to set
;; if you like parens on your params list.  Default values and the
;; like shouldn't confuse it.

;; ## Extract to Let:
;; This is really for use with RSpec

;; 'ruby-refactor-extract-to-let'
;; There is a variable for where the 'let' gets placed. It can be
;; \"top\" which is top-most in the file, or \"closest\" which just
;; walks up to the first describe/context it finds.
;; You can also specify a different regex, so that you can just
;; use \"describe\" if you want.
;; If you are on a line:
;;   a = Something.else.doing
;;     becomes
;;   let(:a){ Something.else.doing }

;; If you are selecting a region:
;;   a = Something.else
;;   a.stub(:blah)
;;     becomes
;;   let :a do
;;     _a = Something.else
;;     _a.stub(:blah)
;;     _a
;;   end

;; In both cases, you need the line, first line to have an ' = ' in it,
;; as that drives conversion.

;; There is also the bonus that the let will be placed *after* any other
;; let statements. It appends it to bottom of the list.

;; Oh, if you invoke with a prefix arg (C-u, etc.), it'll swap the placement
;; of the let.  If you have location as top, a prefix argument will place
;; it closest.  I kinda got nutty with this one.


;; ## TODO
;; From the vim plugin, these remain to be done (I don't plan to do them all.)
;;  - remove inline temp (sexy!)
;;  - convert post conditional

;;
;; This is a module to allow the use of the fringe to indicate locations
;; relative to the bounds of the buffer.  rfringe = \"relative fringe\".
;;
;; In emacs, displaying fringe indicators is done via text overlays. In
;; that way, bitmaps in the fringe are attached to the lines of text
;; shown in the buffer window.
;;
;; This works nicely when the fringe is used to indicate information
;; that is relevant to the adjacent line; for example, text overflow, or
;; something similar. But, there isn't a simple way for an application
;; or module to use the fringe to display buffer-relative information -
;; for example, the location of compiler error messages.
;;
;; In fact, using the fringe to communicate this kind of information -
;; buffer-relative positions - is probably more intuitive and is
;; certainly more useful for the user. For example, consider the
;; scrollbar. The position and size of the scrollbar indicates to the
;; user the position and size of the current window relative to the
;; entire buffer. This is information that cound not be easily or
;; appropriately conveyed within the visual text. The fringe is
;; perfectly suited for this purpose.
;;
;; Along those lines, a useful integration of fringe with flymake would
;; be to use fringe bitmaps visually indicate the position of all
;; flymake errors and warnings in the buffer, relative to the beginning
;; and end of the buffer. A quick glance at the fringe would give a
;; visual indication of the number of errors or warnings and their
;; approximate positions.
;;
;; Likewise, a diff mode might want to display fringe indicators for the
;; number and approximate relative position of differences.
;;
;; Doing this is not simple, because of the dependency of fringe bitmaps
;; on text overlays that I described above.  To use the fringe to
;; communicate information regarding buffer-relative positions requires
;; a transformation from \"buffer position\" to \"window position\".  And
;; this transformation must be re-computed each time a window scrolls or
;; changes size.
;;
;; This module addresses that need, and provides that transformation. It
;; allows you to set an indicator that is buffer-relative in the fringe;
;; the indicator automatically redisplays if the window changes size, or
;; scrolls.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; 1. In the simplest case, you can use rfringe to provide a visual
;;    indicator of the top of the region in the buffer, like so:
;;
;;       (rfringe-show-region)
;;
;;    To turn off the indicator, do this:
;;
;;       (rfringe-hide-region)
;;
;;
;; 2. You can also use rfringe to display a set of indicators,
;;    corresponding to a set of locations in the buffer. These might be
;;    the locations of compiler errors, or section beginnings, or
;;    whatever you like.
;;
;;       (setq posns '(79 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 9000 10000))
;;       (mapc 'rfringe-create-relative-indicator posns)
;;
;;    As you scroll through the buffer, the indicators in the fringe remain fixed.
;;
;;    To remove the indicators, do this:
;;
;;       (rfringe-remove-managed-indicators)
;;
;;    By default, rfringe defines advice to extend flymake to display
;;    indicators this way.  This is not the only intended use of rfringe.el,
;;    but it is a good example.

"]) (revive . [(20121022 411) nil "Resume Emacs" single ";;; Commentary:
;;;
;;;		Resume Emacs:		revive.el
;;;
;;;[What is `revive'?]
;;;
;;;	  Revive.el  saves current editing  status including  the window
;;;	splitting   configuration,   which   can't   be   recovered   by
;;;	`desktop.el' nor by `saveconf.el', into a file  and reconstructs
;;;	that status correctly.
;;;
;;;[Installation]
;;;
;;;	  Put revive.el into your elisp  directory included in load-path
;;;	and write the next expressions.
;;;
;;;	  (autoload 'save-current-configuration \"revive\" \"Save status\" t)
;;;	  (autoload 'resume \"revive\" \"Resume Emacs\" t)
;;;	  (autoload 'wipe \"revive\" \"Wipe Emacs\" t)
;;;
;;;	And define favorite keys to those functions.  Here is a sample.
;;;
;;;	  (define-key ctl-x-map \"S\" 'save-current-configuration)
;;;	  (define-key ctl-x-map \"F\" 'resume)
;;;	  (define-key ctl-x-map \"K\" 'wipe)
;;;
;;;[How to use]
;;;
;;;	 Call `save-current-configuration' (`C-x S' if you define key as
;;;	above) when  you want to   save current editing status  and call
;;;	`resume' to restore it.  Numerical prefix  arg to them specifies
;;;	the buffer number in which the editing status will be saved.
;;;
;;;		[Sample Operations]
;;;		C-u 2 C-x S		;save status into the buffer #2
;;;		C-u 3 C-x F		;load status from the buffer #3
;;;
;;;[Save Variables]
;;;
;;;	  Revive.el can save global or local variables.  The default
;;;	variables to be saved are in revive:save-variables-global-default
;;;	and revive:save-variables-local-default.  If you want to save other
;;;	global/local variables, define them in
;;;	revive:save-variables-global-private or
;;;	revive:save-variables-local-private in a form of a list.  If you
;;;	are using `gmhist', the next expression in ~/.emacs is useful.
;;;
;;;		(setq revive:save-variables-global-private
;;;		      '(file-history buffer-history minibuffer-history))
;;;
;;;[Restoring abnormal buffers]
;;;
;;;	  The variable revive:major-mode-command-alist-default holds the
;;;	list of  major-mode  name  vs.   command  name.   For  example,
;;;	mh-rmail  command sees the directory ~/Mail/inbox/ and sets  the
;;;	major-mode  to  'mh-folder-mode.   And  gnus  command  sets  the
;;;	major-mode to  'gnus-Group-mode.   If  you want to define  other
;;;	relations between major-mode and command,  set the user variable
;;;	revive:major-mode-command-alist-private as follows:
;;;
;;;		(setq revive:major-mode-command-alist-private
;;;		  '((your-own-mode	. your-own)
;;;		    (foo-mode		. foo)
;;;		    (\"*Hanoi*\"		. hanoi)
;;;
;;;	it tells revive.el to execute the corresponding command when the
;;;	saved configuration has the buffer with that major-mode. To know
;;;	the major-mode of a certain buffer, type `M-ESC' and `major-mode
;;;	CR'.   And as  you  see above, buffer-name  string  can be  used
;;;	instead of major-mode symbol.
;;;
;;;	  For  other  special modes that  cannot be resumed by executing
;;;	certain function,  define a function to resume and declare it in
;;;	the  variable revive:major-mode-command-alist-private.  In  that
;;;	function, the following values are available.
;;;
;;;		(revive:prop-file-name x)	;file name
;;;		(revive:prop-buffer-name x)	;buffer name
;;;		(revive:prop-major-mode x)	;major-mode
;;;		(revive:prop-point x)		;(point)
;;;		(revive:prop-mark x)		;(mark)
;;;		(revive:prop-varlist x)		;alist of pairs of (var . val)
;;;
;;;[For programmers]
;;;
;;;	  This program provides two powerful functions:
;;;
;;;		* current-window-configuration-printable
;;;		* restore-window-configuration
;;;
;;;	When you want to save a screen your program manages into a file,
;;;	and  restore  it,  save  the  return  value  of  current-window-
;;;	configuration-printable, and read and give it to restore-window-
;;;	configuration.
;;;
;;;	*Sample*
;;;	;;To save
;;;	(insert (prin1-to-string (current-window-configuration-printable)))
;;;	;;To restore
;;;	(restore-window-configuration (read (current-buffer)))
;;;
;;;	Since set-window-configuration cannot set the configuration of
;;;	other frame, the program as below should be useful.
;;;
;;;	*Sample*
;;;	(defun frame-copy-configuration (nth)
;;;	  \"Copy confinguration of current frame to NTH next frame.\"
;;;	  (let ((config (current-window-configuration-printable)))
;;;	    (other-frame nth)
;;;	    (restore-window-configuration config)))

;; Description

;; req-package is a macro wrapper on top of use-package.
;; It's goal is to simplify package dependencies management,
;; when using use-package for your .emacs.

;; Usage

;; 1) Load req-package:

;;    (require 'req-package)

;; 2) Define required packages with dependencies using :require like this:

;;    (req-package dired) ;; you can omit this empty requirement because of dired-single

;;    (req-package dired-single
;;                 :require dired
;;                 :init (...))

;;    (req-package lua-mode
;;                 :init (...))

;;    (req-package flymake)

;;    (req-package flymake-lua
;;                 :require (flymake lua-mode)
;;                 :init (...))

;; 3) To start loading packages in right order:

;;    (req-package-finish)

;; After calling req-package-finish targets list is cleaned and
;; you can start requiring and loading a new bunch of packages.
;; It may be useful when you need to load some package after all.

;; Migrate from use-package

;;    Just replace all (use-package ...) with (req-package [:require DEPS] ...)
;;    and add (req-package-finish) at the end of your configuration file.

;; Note

;;    All use-package parameters are supported, see use-package manual for additional info.

;;    Also there are possible troubles with :defer keyword provided by use-package.
;;    If you want to use it, try :defer all packages in one dependency tree.

;; Changelog:

;;    v0.4-all-cycles:
;;       All cycles of your dependencies will be printed.
;;       Also there are more handy log messages and some bug fixes.
;;    v0.3-cycles:
;;       There are nice error messages about cycled dependencies now.
;;       Cycles printed in a way: pkg1 -> [pkg2 -> ...] pkg1.
;;       It means there is a cycle around pkg1.
;;    v0.2-auto-fetch:
;;       There is no need of explicit :ensure in your code now.
;;       When you req-package it adds :ensure if package is available in your repos.
;;       Also package deps :ensure'd automatically too.
;;       Just write (req-package pkg1 :require pkg2) and all you need will be installed.

;;
;; This is a generalization of an idea by Mickey Petersen of
;; masteringemacs fame: Use one keystroke to jump from a code buffer
;; to the corresponding repl buffer and back again.  This works even if
;; you do other stuff in between, as the last buffer used to jump to a
;; repl is stored in a buffer local variable in the repl buffer.
;;
;; Currently this assumes that the stored command to start the repl
;; will switch to an already open repl buffer if it exists.
;;
;; There are no repl/mode combinations preconfigured, put something
;; like the following in your Emacs setup for php and elisp repl:
;;
;;     (require 'repl-toggle)
;;     (setq rtog/mode-repl-alist '((php-mode . php-boris) (emacs-lisp-mode . ielm)))
;; 
;; This defines a global minor mode, indicated at with 'rt' in the modeline, that
;; grabs \"C-c C-z\" as repl toggling keybinding.
;;
;; I don't know with wich repl modes this actualy works.  If you use
;; this mode, please tell me your rtog/mode-repl-alist, so that I can
;; update the documentation.
;;
;; Known to work:
;;
;; - ~(php-mode . php-boris)~
;; - ~(emacs-lisp-mode . ielm)~
;; - ~(elixir-mode . elixir-mode-iex)~
;; - ~(ruby-mode . inf-ruby)~
;;
;; If you supply the universal prefix argument you can
;;
;; - C-u pass the current line
;; - C-u C-u pass the current defun
;; - C-u C-u C-u pass the the whole current buffer
;;
;; to the repl buffer you switch to.
;;
;; If you set rtog/fullscreen to true, prior to loading this module,
;; the repl-commands will be executed fullscreen, i.e. as single
;; frame, restoring the window-layout on stwitching back to the
;; buffer.

;; redo+.el is bug fix and extended version of XEmacs' redo package.

;; Emacs' normal undo system allows you to undo an arbitrary
;; number of buffer changes.  These undos are recorded as ordinary
;; buffer changes themselves.  So when you break the chain of
;; undos by issuing some other command, you can then undo all
;; the undos.  The chain of recorded buffer modifications
;; therefore grows without bound, truncated only at garbage
;; collection time.
;;
;; The redo/undo system is different in two ways:
;;   1. The undo/redo command chain is only broken by a buffer
;;      modification.  You can move around the buffer or switch
;;      buffers and still come back and do more undos or redos.
;;   2. The `redo' command rescinds the most recent undo without
;;      recording the change as a _new_ buffer change.  It
;;      completely reverses the effect of the undo, which
;;      includes making the chain of buffer modification records
;;      shorter by one, to counteract the effect of the undo
;;      command making the record list longer by one.

;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Save this file as redo+.el, byte compile it and put the
;; resulting redo.elc file in a directory that is listed in
;; load-path.
;;
;; In your .emacs file, add
;;   (require 'redo+)
;; and the system will be enabled.
;;
;; In addition, if you don't want to redo a previous undo, add
;;   (setq undo-no-redo t)
;; You can also use a function `undo-only' instead of `undo'
;; in GNU Emacs 22 or later.

;; ** minor-mode features
;;
;;    - auto-fill boxes (install filladapt for optimal filling)
;;    - motion (beginning-of-line, end-of-line) within box
;;    - S-return rebox-newline
;;    - kill/yank (within box) only text, not box borders

;;
;; ** interesting variables for customization
;;
;;    - `rebox-style-loop'
;;    - `rebox-min-fill-column'
;;    - `rebox-allowance'


;;; Installation:
;;
;; 1. Add rebox2.el to a directory in your load-path.
;;
;; 2. Basic install - add to your \".emacs\":

;;        (global-set-key [(meta q)] 'rebox-dwim)

;;
;;    Note that if you do not need to specify the HUNDREDS digit of the style,
;;    rebox will figure it out based on the major-moe.
;;
;; 3. Full install - use `rebox-mode' in major-mode hooks:
;;
;;        ;; setup rebox for emacs-lisp
;;        (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda ()

;;
;;    Default `rebox-style-loop' should work for most programming modes, however,
;;    you may want to set the style you prefer.
;;
;;    Here is an customization example that
;;
;;      - sets comments to use \"/* ... */\" style in c++-mode

;;
;;; Ideas removed from Fran\303\247ois Pinard's original version

;;; Future improvement ideas:
;;
;; * remove reliance on dynamic binding using `destructuring-bind' or a hash
;; * allow mixed borders \"-=-=-=-=-=-\"

"]) (readline-complete . [(20120705 243) nil "offers completions in shell mode" single ";;; Commentary:

;; I find it particularly annoying that Emacs *shell* buffers do not
;; offer satisfactory completions, but xterm does. I even used
;; ansi-term for a while because of this (oh god). What I really
;; wanted was for Emacs to show completions via auto-complete.el, like
;; every other mode I use often. This package hopes to deliver on that
;; promise.

;; xterm and friends get their completions from readline, a GNU
;; library that is aware of your context and monitors your keystrokes
;; for TABs and what not so you can be shown a list of
;; completions. readline-complete.el gives you a process filter that
;; tries to parse readline completion menus and give Emacs a list of
;; strings that are valid for completion in the current context.

;;; Installation:

;; There is no one \"right\" way to install this package, because it
;; does not provide any user level commands. I find that it works
;; particularly well with shell-mode and auto-complete.el, so I'll
;; describe how my setup works.

;; First, let us setup shell-mode. shell-mode, by default, does not
;; create a tty (terminal) and does not echo input, both of which are
;; required for proper operation. To fix this, adjust the arguments to
;; your shell:

;; (setq explicit-shell-file-name \"bash\")
;; (setq explicit-bash-args '(\"-c\" \"export EMACS=; stty echo; bash\"))
;; (setq comint-process-echoes t)

;; ASIDE: if you call ssh from shell directly, add \"-t\" to explicit-ssh-args to enable terminal.

;; Second, we need to install auto-complete.el. Go ahead and get that
;; from http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/, and follow the
;; instructions for setup.

;; Third, we need to setup readline-complete and enable auto-complete.

;; (require 'readline-complete)
;;
;; (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'shell-mode)
;; (add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ac-rlc-setup-sources)

;; Finally, M-x shell, and start typing!

;; For customization, see the docstrings of `rlc-timeout`,
;; `rlc-attempts`, and `ac-rlc-prompts`.

"]) (rdp . [(20120928 1854) nil "Recursive Descent Parser library" single ";;; Commentary:

;; This library provides a recursive descent parser for parsing
;; languages in buffers. Some support is provided for implementing
;; automatic indentation based on the parser.

;; In general, the only two functions you need to worry about are:

;; * `rdp-parse'        -- parse the current buffer
;; * `rdp-parse-string' -- parse a string (in a temp buffer)

;; A grammar is provided to the parser as an alist of patterns.
;; Patterns are named by symbols, which can reference other
;; patterns. The lisp object type indicates the type of the pattern:

;; * string -- an Emacs regular expression
;; * list   -- \"and\" relationship, each pattern must match in order
;; * vector -- \"or\" relationship, one of the patterns must match
;; * symbol -- recursive reference to another pattern in the alist

;; The global variable `rdp-best' indicates the furthest point reached
;; in the buffer by the parser. If parsing failed (i.e. `rdp-best' is
;; not at the end of the buffer), this is likely to be the position of
;; the syntax error.

;; For example, this grammar parses simple arithmetic with operator
;; precedence and grouping.

;;     (defvar arith-tokens
;;       '((sum       prod  [([+ -] sum)  no-sum])
;;         (prod      value [([* /] prod) no-prod])
;;         (num     . \"-?[0-9]+\\\\(\\\\.[0-9]*\\\\)?\")
;;         (+       . \"\\\\+\")
;;         (-       . \"-\")
;;         (*       . \"\\\\*\")
;;         (/       . \"/\")
;;         (pexpr     \"(\" [sum prod num pexpr] \")\")
;;         (value   . [pexpr num])
;;         (no-prod . \"\")
;;         (no-sum  . \"\")))

;; Given just this grammar to `rdp-parse' it will return an
;; s-expression of the input where each token match is `cons'ed with
;; the token name. To make this more useful, the s-expression can be
;; manipulated as it is read using an alist of token names and
;; functions. This could be used to simplify the s-expression, build
;; an interpreter that interprets during parsing, or even build a
;; compiler.

;; For example, this function alist evaluates the arithmetic as it is
;; parsed:

;;     (defun arith-op (expr)
;;       (destructuring-bind (a (op b)) expr
;;         (funcall op a b)))
;;
;;     (defvar arith-funcs
;;       `((sum     . ,#'arith-op)
;;         (prod    . ,#'arith-op)
;;         (num     . ,#'string-to-number)
;;         (+       . ,#'intern)
;;         (-       . ,#'intern)
;;         (*       . ,#'intern)
;;         (/       . ,#'intern)
;;         (pexpr   . ,#'cadr)
;;         (value   . ,#'identity)
;;         (no-prod . ,(lambda (e) '(* 1)))
;;         (no-sum  . ,(lambda (e) '(+ 0)))))

;; Putting this all together:

;; (defun arith (string)
;;   (rdp-parse-string string arith-tokens arith-funcs))
;;
;; (arith \"(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * -3/4.0\")

;; Tips:

;; Recursive descent parsers *cannot* be left-recursive. It is
;; important that a pattern does not recurse without first consuming
;; some input. Any grammar can be made non-left-recursive but not
;; necessarily simplistically.

;; The parser requires a lot of stack! Consider increasing
;; `max-lisp-eval-depth' by some factor before calling
;; `rdp-parse'. After increasing it, running out of stack space is
;; likely an indication of left-recursion somewhere in the grammar.

;; Token functions should not have side effects. Due to the
;; backtracking of the parser, just because the function was called
;; doesn't mean there was actually a successful match. Also, these
;; functions are free to return nil or the empty list as such a return
;; is *not* an indication of failure.

;; By default, whitespace is automatically consumed between matches
;; using the function `rdp-skip-whitespace'. If some kinds of
;; whitespace are important or if there are other characters that need
;; to be skipped, temporarily override this function with your own
;; definition using `flet' when calling `rdp-parse'.

;; In general don't try to parse comments in the grammar. Strip them
;; from the buffer before calling the parser.

;; Indentation facilities:

;; To find out where in the parse tree a point lies, set `rdp-start'
;; to the desired point before starting parsing. After parsing, either
;; successfully or not,`rdp-point-stack' will contain a stack of
;; tokens indicating roughly where in the parse tree the point
;; lies.

;; To use this for rudimentary indentation, set `rdp-start' to the
;; `beginning-of-line' of the current point and count how many
;; indent-worthy tokens are in the stack once parsing is complete.

;;
;; - five different types of alerts are considered here, three of them may be disabled

;;   \"keyword\" - keyword detected
;;   \"private\" - private message (always enabled)
;;   \"nick\"    - given nicks changes status (join, ...)
;;   \"always\"  - alert of any message

;;
;; Rainbow-delimiters is a \342\200\234rainbow parentheses\342\200\235-like mode which highlights
;; parentheses, brackets, and braces according to their depth. Each
;; successive level is highlighted in a different color. This makes it easy
;; to spot matching delimiters, orient yourself in the code, and tell which
;; statements are at a given level.
;;
;; Great care has been taken to make this mode FAST. You shouldn't see
;; any discernible change in scrolling or editing speed while using it,
;; even in delimiter-rich languages like Clojure, Lisp, and Scheme.
;;
;; Default colors are subtle, with the philosophy that syntax highlighting
;; shouldn't be visually intrusive. Color schemes are always a matter of
;; taste.  If you take the time to design a new color scheme, please share
;; (even a simple list of colors works) on the EmacsWiki page or via github.
;; EmacsWiki: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RainbowDelimiters
;; Github: http://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters


;;; Installation:

;; 1. Place rainbow-delimiters.el on your emacs load-path.
;;
;; 2. Compile the file (necessary for speed):
;; M-x byte-compile-file <location of rainbow-delimiters.el>
;;
;; 3. Add the following to your dot-emacs/init file:
;; (require 'rainbow-delimiters)
;;
;; 4. Activate the mode in your init file.
;;    You can choose to enable it only in certain modes, or Emacs-wide:
;;
;; - To enable it only in certain modes, add lines like the following:
;; (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;;
;; - To enable it in all programming-related emacs modes (Emacs 24+):
;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;;
;; - To activate the mode globally, add to your init file:
;; (global-rainbow-delimiters-mode)
;;
;; - To temporarily activate rainbow-delimiters mode in an open buffer:
;; M-x rainbow-delimiters-mode
;;
;; - To toggle global-rainbow-delimiters-mode:
;; M-x global-rainbow-delimiters-mode

;;; Customization:

;; To customize various options, including the color scheme:
;; M-x customize-group rainbow-delimiters
;;
;; deftheme / color-theme.el users:
;; You can specify custom colors by adding the appropriate faces to your theme.
;; - Faces take the form of:
;;   'rainbow-delimiters-depth-#-face' with # being the depth.
;;   Depth begins at 1, the outermost color.
;;   Faces exist for depths 1-9.
;; - The unmatched delimiter face (normally colored red) is:
;;   'rainbow-delimiters-unmatched-face'

;; Django project management package with the goodies you would expect
;; and then some.  The project buffer workings is pretty much inspired
;; by the good ol' `magit-status' buffer.

;; This package relies heavily in fgallina's `python.el' available in
;; stock Emacs>=24.3 (or https://github.com/fgallina/python.el).

;; Implements File navigation (per app, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT and
;; TEMPLATE_DIRS), Etag building, Grep in project, Quick jump (to
;; settings, project root, virtualenv and docs), Management commands
;; and Quick management commands.

;; File navigation: After opening a project, a directory tree for each
;; installed app, the STATIC_ROOT, the MEDIA_ROOT and each
;; TEMPLATE_DIRS is created.  Several commands are provided to work
;; with the current directory at point.

;; Etags building: Provides a simple wrapper to create etags for
;; current opened project.

;; Grep in project: Provides a simple way to grep relevant project
;; directories using `rgrep'.  You can override the use of `rgrep' by
;; tweaking the `python-django-cmd-grep-function'.

;; Quick jump: fast key bindings to jump to the settings module, the
;; project root, the current virtualenv and Django official web docs
;; are provided.

;; Management commands: You can run any management command from the
;; project buffer via `python-django-mgmt-run-command' or via the
;; quick management commands accesible from the Django menu.
;; Completion is provided for all arguments and you can cycle through
;; opened management command process buffers very easily.  Another
;; cool feature is that comint processes are spiced up with special
;; processing, for instance if are using runserver and get a
;; breakpoint via pdb or ipdb the pdb-tracking provided by
;; `python-mode' will trigger or if you enter dbshell the proper
;; `sql-mode' will be used.

;; Quick management commands: This mode provides quick management
;; commands (management commands with sane defaults, smart prompt
;; completion and process extra processing) defined to work with the
;; most used Django built-in management commands like syncdb, shell,
;; runserver, test; several good ones from `django-extensions' like
;; shell_plus, clean_pyc; and `south' ones like convert_to_south,
;; migrate, schemamigration.  You can define new quick commands via
;; the `python-django-qmgmt-define' and define ways to handle when
;; it's finished by defining a callback function.

;; This program is tested on GNU Emacs 22, 23 under X window system and

;;
;; Installation:
;;

;;
;; Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'pos-tip)

;;
;; or
;;

;;
;; We can display a tooltip at the current position by the following:
;;
;;   (pos-tip-show \"foo bar\")
;;
;; If you'd like to specify the tooltip color, use an expression as:

;; 
;; Then try to show some buffer, for example *Help* or
;; *Completeions*. Unlike standard behavior, their buffers may be
;; shown in a popup window at the bottom of the frame. And you can
;; close the popup window seamlessly by typing C-g or selecting other
;; windows.
;;
;; `popwin:display-buffer' displays special buffers in a popup window
;; and displays normal buffers as unsual. Special buffers are
;; specified in `popwin:special-display-config', which tells popwin
;; how to display such buffers. See docstring of
;; `popwin:special-display-config' for more information.
;;
;; The default width/height/position of popup window can be changed by
;; setting `popwin:popup-window-width', `popwin:popup-window-height',
;; and `popwin:popup-window-position'.  You can also change the
;; behavior for a specific buffer. See docstring of
;; `popwin:special-display-config'.
;;
;; If you want to use some useful commands such like
;; `popwin:popup-buffer' and `popwin:find-file' easily. you may bind

;; directory as this Elisp file.  You can use `setq' in your
;; configuration file to set the variable to the proper path if the
;; PHP program is in a different directory, e.g:
;;
;;     (require 'php-auto-yasnippets)
;;     (setq php-auto-yasnippet-php-program \"~/path/to/Create-PHP-YASnippet.php\")
;;
;; Finally, bind the function `yas/create-php-snippet' to a key of
;; your choice.  Since this package requires php-mode, and since it is
;; most useful when writing PHP code, you may want to use a
;; key-binding that only works when using php-mode.  For example:
;;
;;     (define-key php-mode-map (kbd \"C-c C-y\") 'yas/create-php-snippet)
;;
;; Now if you type the name of a PHP function and press `C-c C-y' it
;; will expand into a snippet containing all of the parameters, their
;; names, any default values, et cetera.  If you type the name of a
;; method then you need to tell the package the name of the class that
;; implements that method, otherwise it will not be able to create the
;; snippet.  Using the prefix command, e.g. `C-u C-c C-y', prompts for
;; the class name in the minibuffer.

;;; Overview ==========================================================
;;
;; This module lets you access the PostgreSQL object-relational DBMS
;; from Emacs, using its socket-level frontend/backend protocol. The
;; module is capable of automatic type coercions from a range of SQL
;; types to the equivalent Emacs Lisp type. This is a low level API,
;; and won't be useful to end users. Should work with GNU Emacs 19.34
;; and up, and XEmacs 20 and up. Performance is very poor when not
;; byte-compiled.

;;; Entry points =======================================================
;;
;; (with-pg-connection con (dbname user [password host port]) &body body)
;;     A macro which opens a connection to database DBNAME, executes the
;;     BODY forms then disconnects. See function `pg:connect' for details
;;     of the connection arguments.
;;
;; (with-pg-transaction con &body body)
;;     A macro which executes the BODY forms wrapped in an SQL transaction.
;;     CON is a connection to the database. If an error occurs during the
;;     execution of the forms, a ROLLBACK instruction is executed.
;;
;; (pg:connect dbname user [password host port]) -> connection
;;     Connect to the database DBNAME on HOST (defaults to localhost)
;;     at PORT (defaults to 5432) via TCP/IP and log in as USER. If
;;     the database requires a password, send PASSWORD as clear text.
;;     Set the output date type to 'ISO', and initialize our type
;;     parser tables.
;;
;; (pg:exec connection &rest sql) -> pgresult
;;     Concatenate the SQL strings and send to the backend. Retrieve
;;     all the information returned by the database and return it in
;;     an opaque record PGRESULT.
;;
;; (pg:result pgresult what &rest args) -> info
;;     Extract information from the PGRESULT. The WHAT keyword can be
;;     one of
;;          * :connection
;;          * :status
;;          * :attributes
;;          * :tuples
;;          * :tuple tupleNumber
;;          * :oid
;;     `:connection' allows you to retrieve the database connection.
;;     `:status' is a string returned by the backend to indicate the
;;     status of the command; it is something like \"SELECT\" for a
;;     select command, \"DELETE 1\" if the deletion affected a single
;;     row, etc. `:attributes' is a list of tuples providing metadata:
;;     the first component of each tuple is the attribute's name as a
;;     string, the second an integer representing its PostgreSQL type,
;;     and the third an integer representing the size of that type.
;;     `:tuples' returns all the data retrieved from the database, as a
;;     list of lists, each list corresponding to one row of data
;;     returned by the backend. `:tuple num' can be used to extract a
;;     specific tuple (numbering starts at 0). `:oid' allows you to
;;     retrieve the OID returned by the backend if the command was an
;;     insertion; the OID is a unique identifier for that row in the
;;     database (this is PostgreSQL-specific, please refer to the
;;     documentation for more details).
;;
;; (pg:disconnect connection) -> nil
;;     Close the database connection.
;;
;; (pg:for-each connection select-form callback)
;;     Calls CALLBACK on each tuple returned by SELECT-FORM. Declares
;;     a cursor for SELECT-FORM, then fetches tuples using repeated
;;     executions of FETCH 1, until no results are left. The cursor is
;;     then closed. The work is performed within a transaction. When
;;     you have a large amount of data to handle, this usage is more
;;     efficient than fetching all the tuples in one go.
;;
;;     If you wish to browse the results, each one in a separate
;;     buffer, you could have the callback insert each tuple into a
;;     buffer created with (generate-new-buffer \"myprefix\"), then use
;;     ibuffer's \"/ n\" to list/visit/delete all buffers whose names
;;     match myprefix.
;;
;; (pg:databases connection) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the databases available at this site (a
;;     database is a set of tables; in a virgin PostgreSQL
;;     installation there is a single database named \"template1\").
;;
;; (pg:tables connection) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the tables present in the database to which we
;;     are currently connected. Only include user tables: system
;;     tables are excluded.
;;
;; (pg:columns connection table) -> list of strings
;;     Return a list of the columns (or attributes) in TABLE, which
;;     must be a table in the database to which we are currently
;;     connected. We only include the column names; if you want more
;;     detailed information (attribute types, for example), it can be
;;     obtained from `pg:result' on a SELECT statement for that table.
;;
;; (pg:lo-create conn . args) -> oid
;;     Create a new large object (BLOB, or binary large object in
;;     other DBMSes parlance) in the database to which we are
;;     connected via CONN. Returns an OID (which is represented as an
;;     elisp integer) which will allow you to use the large object.
;;     Optional ARGS are a Unix-style mode string which determines the
;;     permissions of the newly created large object, one of \"r\" for
;;     read-only permission, \"w\" for write-only, \"rw\" for read+write.
;;     Default is \"r\".
;;
;;     Large-object functions MUST be used within a transaction (see
;;     the macro `with-pg-transaction').
;;
;; (pg:lo-open conn oid . args) -> fd
;;     Open a large object whose unique identifier is OID (an elisp
;;     integer) in the database to which we are connected via CONN.
;;     Optional ARGS is a Unix-style mode string as for pg:lo-create;
;;     which defaults to \"r\" read-only permissions. Returns a file
;;     descriptor (an elisp integer) which can be used in other
;;     large-object functions.
;;
;; (pg:lo-close conn fd)
;;     Close the file descriptor FD which was associated with a large
;;     object. Note that this does not delete the large object; use
;;     `pg:lo-unlink' for that.
;;
;; (pg:lo-read conn fd bytes) -> string
;;     Read BYTES from the file descriptor FD which is associated with
;;     a large object. Return an elisp string which should be BYTES
;;     characters long.
;;
;; (pg:lo-write connection fd buf)
;;     Write the bytes contained in the elisp string BUF to the
;;     large object associated with the file descriptor FD. 
;;
;; (pg:lo-lseek conn fd offset whence)
;;     Do the equivalent of a lseek(2) on the file descriptor FD which
;;     is associated with a large object; ie reposition the read/write
;;     file offset for that large object to OFFSET (an elisp
;;     integer). WHENCE has the same significance as in lseek(); it
;;     should be one of SEEK_SET (set the offset to the absolute
;;     position), SEEK_CUR (set the offset relative to the current
;;     offset) or SEEK_END (set the offset relative to the end of the
;;     file). WHENCE should be an elisp integer whose values can be
;;     obtained from the header file <unistd.h> (probably 0, 1 and 2
;;     respectively).
;;
;; (pg:lo-tell conn oid) -> integer
;;     Do the equivalent of an ftell(3) on the file associated with
;;     the large object whose unique identifier is OID. Returns the
;;     current position of the file offset for the object's associated
;;     file descriptor, as an elisp integer.
;;
;; (pg:lo-unlink conn oid)
;;     Remove the large object whose unique identifier is OID from the
;;     system (in the current implementation of large objects in
;;     PostgreSQL, each large object is associated with an object in
;;     the filesystem).
;;
;; (pg:lo-import conn filename) -> oid
;;     Create a new large object and initialize it to the data
;;     contained in the file whose name is FILENAME. Returns an OID
;;     (as an elisp integer). Note that is operation is only syntactic
;;     sugar around the basic large-object operations listed above.
;;
;; (pg:lo-export conn oid filename)
;;     Create a new file named FILENAME and fill it with the contents
;;     of the large object whose unique identifier is OID. This
;;     operation is also syntactic sugar.
;;
;;
;; Boolean variable `pg:disable-type-coercion' which can be set to
;; non-nil (before initiating a connection) to disable the library's
;; type coercion facility. Default is t.
;;
;;
;; The interface is pretty slow (byte compiling helps a lot). Maybe
;; someone can suggest a better way of reading input from the network
;; stream. Please note that your postmaster has to be started with the
;; `-i' option in order to accept TCP/IP connections (this is not the
;; default). For more information about PostgreSQL see
;; <URL:http://www.PostgreSQL.org/>.
;;
;; Thanks to Eric Ludlam <zappo@gnu.org> for discovering a bug in the
;; date parsing routines, to Hartmut Pilch and Yoshio Katayama for
;; adding multibyte support, and to Doug McNaught and Pavel Janik for
;; bug fixes.


;; SECURITY NOTE: setting up PostgreSQL to accept TCP/IP connections
;; has security implications; please consult the documentation for
;; details. pg.el supports neither the crypt authentication method,
;; nor Kerberos (support for these can't be added to Emacs due to
;; silly US crypto export regulations). However, it is possible to use
;; the port forwarding capabilities of ssh to establish a connection
;; to the backend over TCP/IP, which provides both a secure
;; authentication mechanism and encryption (and optionally
;; compression) of data passing through the tunnel. Here's how to do
;; it (thanks to Gene Selkov, Jr. <selkovjr@mcs.anl.gov> for the
;; description):
;;
;; 1. Establish a tunnel to the backend machine, like this:
;; 
;; 	ssh -L 3333:backend.dom:5432 postgres@backend.dom
;; 
;;    The first number in the -L argument, 3333, is the port number of
;;    your end of the tunnel. The second number, 5432, is the remote
;;    end of the tunnel -- the port number your backend is using. The
;;    name or the address in between the port numbers belongs to the
;;    server machine, as does the last argument to ssh that also includes
;;    the optional user name. Without the user name, ssh will try the
;;    name you are currently logged on as on the client machine. You can
;;    use any user name the server machine will accept, not necessarily
;;    those related to postgres.
;; 
;; 2. Now that you have a running ssh session, you can point pg.el to
;;    the local host at the port number which you specified in step 1.
;;    For example,
;;
;;         (pg:connect \"dbname\" \"user\" \"password\" \"localhost\" 3333)
;;
;;    You can omit the port argument if you chose 5432 as the local
;;    end of the tunnel, since pg.el defaults to this value.


;;; INSTALL =========================================================
;;
;; Place this file in a directory somewhere in the load-path, then
;; byte-compile it (do a `B' on it in dired, for example). Place a
;; line such as `(require 'pg)' in your emacs initialization file.


;;; TODO ============================================================
;;
;; * add a mechanism for parsing user-defined types. The user should
;;   be able to define a parse function and a type-name; we query
;;   pg_type to get the type's OID and add the information to
;;   pg:parsers.
;;
;; * in a future release I will probably modify the numeric conversion
;;   routines to return elisp floating point values instead of elisp
;;   integers, in order to work around possible overflow problems.

;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; This is a wrapper around pcache.el, providing \"soft\" fetch and
;; store routines which never throw an error, but instead return
;; nil on failure.
;;
;; There is no end-user interface for this library.  It is only
;; useful from other Lisp code.
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `persistent-soft-store'
;;     `persistent-soft-fetch'
;;     `persistent-soft-exists-p'
;;     `persistent-soft-flush'
;;     `persistent-soft-location-readable'
;;     `persistent-soft-location-destroy'
;;
;; To use persistent-soft, place the persistent-soft.el library
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your
;; ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'persistent-soft)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET persistent-soft RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     Using pcache with a more recent version of CEDET gives
;;
;;         Unsafe call to `eieio-persistent-read'.
;;         eieio-persistent-read: Wrong type argument: class-p, nil
;;
;;     This library provides something of a workaround.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements

;;     GNU Emacs version 24.4-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes

;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no
;;
;;     Uses if present: pcache.el (all operations are noops when
;;     not present)
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Persistent-soft is a wrapper around pcache which is a wrapper
;;     around eieio.  Therefore, persistent-soft should probably be
;;     rewritten to use eieio directly or recast as a patch to pcache.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Setting print-quoted doesn't seem to influence EIEIO.
;;     It doesn't seem right that the sanitization stuff
;;     is needed.

;;
;; Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG) are a formalism in the spirit of
;; Context Free Grammars (CFG) with some simplifications which makes
;; the implementation of PEGs as recursive descent parser particularly
;; simple and easy to understand [Ford, Baker].
;;
;; This file implements a macro `peg-parse' which parses the current
;; buffer according to a PEG.  E.g. we can match integers with a PEG
;; like this:
;;
;;  (peg-parse (number   sign digit (* digit))
;;             (sign     (or \"+\" \"-\" \"\"))
;;             (digit    [0-9]))
;;
;; In contrast to regexps, PEGs allow us to define recursive \"rules\".
;; A \"grammar\" is a list of rules.  A rule is written as (NAME PEX...)
;; E.g. (sign (or \"+\" \"-\" \"\")) is a rule with the name \"sign\".  The
;; syntax for PEX (Parsing Expression) is a follows:
;;
;; Description   	Lisp		Traditional, as in Ford's paper
;; Sequence 		(and e1 e2)    	e1 e2
;; Prioritized Choice   (or e1 e2)	e1 / e2
;; Not-predicate 	(not e)		!e
;; And-predicate	(if e)		&e
;; Any character	(any)		.
;; Literal string	\"abc\"		\"abc\"
;; Character C		(char c)	'c'
;; Zero-or-more 	(* e)		e*
;; One-or-more 		(+ e)		e+
;; Optional		(opt e)		e?
;; Character range	(range a b)	[a-b]
;; Character set	[a-b \"+*\" ?x]	[a-b+*x]  ; note: [] is a elisp vector
;; Character classes    [ascii cntrl]
;; Beginning-of-Buffer  (bob)
;; End-of-Buffer        (eob)
;; Beginning-of-Line    (bol)
;; End-of-Line        	(eol)
;; Beginning-of-Word    (bow)
;; End-of-Word        	(eow)
;; Beginning-of-Symbol  (bos)
;; End-of-Symbol       	(eos)
;; Syntax-Class       	(syntax-class NAME)
;;
;; `peg-parse' also supports parsing actions, i.e. Lisp snippets which
;; are executed when a pex matches.  This can be used to construct
;; syntax trees or for similar tasks.  Actions are written as
;;
;;  (action FORM)          ; evaluate FORM
;;  `(VAR... -- FORM...)   ; stack action
;; 
;; Actions don't consume input, but are executed at the point of
;; match.  A \"stack action\" takes VARs from the \"value stack\" and
;; pushes the result of evaluating FORMs to that stack.  See
;; `peg-ex-parse-int' for an example.
;;
;; Derived Operators:
;;
;; The following operators are implemented as combinations of
;; primitive expressions:
;;
;; (substring E)  ; match E and push the substring for the matched region
;; (region E)     ; match E and push the corresponding start and end positions
;; (replace E RPL); match E and replace the matched region with RPL.
;; (list E)       ; match E and push a list out of the items that E produces.
;;
;; Regexp equivalents:
;;
;; Here a some examples for regexps and how those could be written as pex.
;; [Most are taken from rx.el]
;;
;; \"^[a-z]*\"
;; (and (bol) (* [a-z]))
;;
;; \"\\n[^ \\t]\"
;; (and \"\\n\" (not [\" \\t\"]) (any))
;;
;; \"\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* EOOH \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\"
;; \"*** EOOH ***\\n\"

;; 1 Overview
;; ==========

;;   `pcre2el' or `rxt' (RegeXp Translator or RegeXp Tools) is a utility
;;   for working with regular expressions in Emacs, based on a
;;   recursive-descent parser for regexp syntax. In addition to converting
;;   (a subset of) PCRE syntax into its Emacs equivalent, it can do the
;;   following:

;;   - convert Emacs syntax to PCRE
;;   - convert either syntax to `rx', an S-expression based regexp syntax
;;   - provide live font-locking of regexp syntax (so far only for Elisp
;;     buffers -- other modes on the TODO list)
;;   - untangle complex regexps by showing the parse tree in `rx' form and
;;     highlighting the corresponding chunks of code
;;   - show the complete list of strings (productions) matching a regexp,
;;     provided the list is finite


;; 2 Usage
;; =======

;;   Enable `rxt-minor-mode' or its global equivalent `rxt-global-mode' to
;;   get the default key-bindings. There are three sets of commands:
;;   commands that take a PCRE regexp, commands which take an Emacs regexp,
;;   and commands that try to do the right thing based on the current mode.
;;   Currently, this means Emacs syntax in `emacs-lisp-mode' and
;;   `lisp-interaction-mode', and PCRE syntax everywhere else.

;;   The default key bindings all begin with `C-c /' and have a mnemonic
;;   structure: `C-c / <source> <target>', or just `C-c / <target>' for the
;;   \"do what I mean\" commands. The complete list of key bindings is given
;;   here and explained in more detail below:

;;   - \"Do-what-I-mean\" commands:
;;     `C-c / /': `rxt-explain'
;;     `C-c / c': `rxt-convert-syntax'
;;     `C-c / x': `rxt-convert-to-rx'
;;     `C-c / '': `rxt-convert-to-strings'

;;   - Commands that work on a PCRE regexp:
;;     `C-c / p e': `rxt-pcre-to-elisp'
;;     `C-c / %': `pcre-query-replace-regexp'
;;     `C-c / p x': `rxt-pcre-to-rx'
;;     `C-c / p s': `rxt-pcre-to-sre'
;;     `C-c / p '': `rxt-pcre-to-strings'
;;     `C-c / p /': `rxt-explain-pcre'

;;   - Commands that work on an Emacs regexp:
;;     `C-c / e /': `rxt-explain-elisp'
;;     `C-c / e p': `rxt-elisp-to-pcre'
;;     `C-c / e x': `rxt-elisp-to-rx'
;;     `C-c / e s': `rxt-elisp-to-sre'
;;     `C-c / e '': `rxt-elisp-to-strings'
;;     `C-c / e t': `rxt-toggle-elisp-rx'
;;     `C-c / t': `rxt-toggle-elisp-rx'
;;     `C-c / h': `rxt-fontify-regexp-at-point'


;; 2.1 Interactive input and output
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   When used interactively, the conversion commands can read a regexp
;;   either from the current buffer or from the minibuffer. The output is
;;   displayed in the minibuffer and copied to the kill-ring.

;;   - When called with a prefix argument (`C-u'), they read a regular
;;     expression from the minibuffer literally, without further processing
;;     -- meaning there's no need to double the backslashes if it's an
;;     Emacs regexp. This is the same way commands like
;;     `query-replace-regexp' read input.

;;   - When the region is active, they use they the region contents, again
;;     literally (without any translation of string syntax).

;;   - With neither a prefix arg nor an active region, the behavior depends
;;     on whether the command expects an Emacs regexp or a PCRE one.

;;     Commands that take an Emacs regexp behave like `C-x C-e': they
;;     evaluate the sexp before point (which could be simply a string
;;     literal) and use its value. This is designed for use in Elisp
;;     buffers. As a special case, if point is *inside* a string, it's
;;     first moved to the string end, so in practice they should work as
;;     long as point is somewhere within the regexp literal.

;;     Commands that take a PCRE regexp try to read a Perl-style delimited
;;     regex literal *after* point in the current buffer, including its
;;     flags. For example, putting point before the `m' in the following
;;     example and doing `C-c / p e' (`rxt-pcre-to-elisp') displays
;;     `\\(?:bar\\|foo\\)', correctly stripping out the whitespace and
;;     comment:

;;     ,----
;;     | $x =~ m/  foo   |  (?# comment) bar /x
;;     `----

;;     The PCRE reader currently only works with `/ ... /' delimiters. It
;;     will ignore any preceding `m', `s', or `qr' operator, as well as the
;;     replacement part of an `s' construction.

;;     Readers for other PCRE-using languages are on the TODO list.

;;   The translation functions display their result in the minibuffer and
;;   copy it to the kill ring. When translating something into Elisp
;;   syntax, you might need to use the result either literally (e.g. for
;;   interactive input to a command like `query-replace-regexp'), or as a
;;   string to paste into Lisp code. To allow both uses,
;;   `rxt-pcre-to-elisp' copies both versions successively to the
;;   kill-ring. The literal regexp without string quoting is the top
;;   element of the kill-ring, while the Lisp string is the
;;   second-from-top. You can paste the literal regexp somewhere by doing
;;   `C-y', or the Lisp string by `C-y M-y'.


;; 2.2 Syntax conversion commands
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   `rxt-convert-syntax' (`C-c / c') converts between Emacs and PCRE
;;   syntax, depending on the major mode in effect when called.
;;   Alternatively, you can specify the conversion direction explicitly by
;;   using either `rxt-pcre-to-elisp' (`C-c / p e') or `rxt-elisp-to-pcre'
;;   (`C-c / e p').

;;   Similarly, `rxt-convert-to-rx' (`C-c / x') converts either kind of
;;   syntax to `rx' form, while `rxt-convert-pcre-to-rx' (`C-c / p x') and
;;   `rxt-convert-elisp-to-rx' (`C-c / e x') convert to `rx' from a
;;   specified source type.

;;   In Elisp buffers, you can use `rxt-toggle-elisp-rx' (`C-c / t' or `C-c
;;   / e t') to switch the regexp at point back and forth between string
;;   and `rx' syntax. Point should either be within an `rx' or
;;   `rx-to-string' form or a string literal for this to work.


;; 2.3 Query replace
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   `pcre-query-replace-regexp' does query-replace using emulated PCRE
;;   regexps. It is bound to `C-c / %' by default, by analogy with `M-%'.

;;   Put the following in your `.emacs' if you want to use PCRE query
;;   replacement everywhere:

;;   ,----
;;   | (global-set-key [(meta %)] 'pcre-query-replace-regexp)
;;   `----


;; 2.4 Syntax highlighting (font-lock)
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   In Elisp buffers, you can have a regular expression in a string
;;   syntax-highlighted by putting point on it and doing
;;   `rxt-fontify-regexp-at-point' (`C-c / h'). Call the command a second
;;   time to remove the highlighting, or call with a prefix argument to
;;   remove all regexp highlighting in a buffer.

;;   As long as syntax highlighting is enabled, any edits to the string are
;;   highlighted \"live\" after a small delay. You can have as many strings
;;   highlighted at once as you like, but too many might slow down display.

;;   This feature doesn't work for any other language modes yet, but it
;;   would be easy to implement.


;; 2.5 Explain regexps
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   When syntax-highlighting isn't enough to untangle some gnarly regexp
;;   you find in the wild, try the 'explain' commands: `rxt-explain' (`C-c
;;   / /'), `rxt-explain-pcre' (`C-c / p') and `rxt-explain-elisp' (`C-c /
;;   e'). These display the original regexp along with its pretty-printed
;;   `rx' equivalent in a new buffer. Moving moving point around either in
;;   the original regexp or the `rx' translation highlights the
;;   corresponding pieces of syntax, which helps in seeing things like what
;;   the scope of quantifiers is.

;;   I call them \"explain\" commands because the `rx' form is close to a
;;   plain syntax tree, and this plus the wordiness of the operators
;;   usually helps to clarify what is going on. People who dislike Lisp
;;   syntax might disagree, of course ... ;-)


;; 2.6 Generate all matching strings (productions)
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Occasionally you come across a regexp which is designed to match a
;;   finite set of strings, e.g. a set of keywords, and it would be useful
;;   to recover the original set. (In Emacs you can generate such regexps
;;   using `regexp-opt'). The commands `rxt-convert-to-strings' (`C-c /
;;   \342\200\262'), `rxt-pcre-to-strings' (`C-c / p \342\200\262') or `rxt-elisp-to-strings'
;;   (`C-c / e \342\200\262') accomplish this by generating all the matching strings
;;   (\"productions\") of a regexp. (The productions are copied to the kill
;;   ring as a Lisp list).

;;   An example in Lisp code:

;;   ,----
;;   | (regexp-opt '(\"cat\" \"caterpillar\" \"catatonic\"))
;;   |    ;; => \"\\\\(?:cat\\\\(?:atonic\\\\|erpillar\\\\)?\\\\)\"
;;   | (rxt-elisp-to-strings \"\\\\(?:cat\\\\(?:atonic\\\\|erpillar\\\\)?\\\\)\")
;;   |     ;; => '(\"cat\" \"caterpillar\" \"catatonic\")
;;   `----

;;   For obvious reasons, these commands only work with regexps that don't
;;   include any unbounded quantifiers like `+' or `*'. They also can't
;;   enumerate all the characters that match a named character class like
;;   `[[:alnum:]]'. In either case they will give a (hopefully meaningful)
;;   error message. Due to the nature of permutations, it's still possible
;;   for a finite regexp to generate a huge number of productions, which
;;   will eat memory and slow down your Emacs. Be ready with `C-g' if
;;   necessary ;-)


;; 2.7 RE-Builder support
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   The Emacs RE-Builder is a useful visual tool which allows using
;;   several different built-in syntaxes via `reb-change-syntax' (`C-c
;;   TAB'). It supports Elisp read and literal syntax and `rx', but it can
;;   only convert from the symbolic forms to Elisp, not the other way. This
;;   package hacks the RE-Builder to also work with emulated PCRE syntax,
;;   and to convert transparently between Elisp, PCRE and rx syntaxes. PCRE
;;   mode reads a delimited Perl-like literal of the form `/ ... /', and it
;;   should correctly support using the `x' and `s' flags.


;; 2.8 Use from Lisp
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   Example of using the conversion functions:
;;   ,----
;;   | (rxt-pcre-to-elisp \"(abc|def)\\\\w+\\\\d+\")
;;   |    ;; => \"\\\\(\\\\(?:abc\\\\|def\\\\)\\\\)[_[:alnum:]]+[[:digit:]]+\"
;;   `----

;;   All the conversion functions take a single string argument, the regexp
;;   to translate:

;;   - `rxt-pcre-to-elisp'
;;   - `rxt-pcre-to-rx'
;;   - `rxt-pcre-to-sre'
;;   - `rxt-pcre-to-strings'
;;   - `rxt-elisp-to-pcre'
;;   - `rxt-elisp-to-rx'
;;   - `rxt-elisp-to-sre'
;;   - `rxt-elisp-to-strings'


;; 3 Bugs and Limitations
;; ======================

;; 3.1 Limitations on PCRE syntax
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   PCRE has a complicated syntax and semantics, only some of which can be
;;   translated into Elisp. The following subset of PCRE should be
;;   correctly parsed and converted:

;;   - parenthesis grouping `( .. )', including shy matches `(?: ... )'
;;   - backreferences (various syntaxes), but only up to 9 per expression
;;   - alternation `|'
;;   - greedy and non-greedy quantifiers `*', `*?', `+', `+?', `?' and `??'
;;     (all of which are the same in Elisp as in PCRE)
;;   - numerical quantifiers `{M,N}'
;;   - beginning/end of string `\\A', `\\Z'
;;   - string quoting `\\Q .. \\E'
;;   - word boundaries `\\b', `\\B' (these are the same in Elisp)
;;   - single character escapes `\\a', `\\c', `\\e', `\\f', `\\n', `\\r', `\\t',
;;     `\\x', and `\\octal digits' (but see below about non-ASCII characters)
;;   - character classes `[...]' including Posix escapes
;;   - character classes `\\d', `\\D', `\\h', `\\H', `\\s', `\\S', `\\v', `\\V'
;;     both within character class brackets and outside
;;   - word and non-word characters `\\w' and `\\W' (Emacs has the same
;;     syntax, but its meaning is different)
;;   - `s' (single line) and `x' (extended syntax) flags, in regexp
;;     literals, or set within the expression via `(?xs-xs)' or `(?xs-xs:
;;     .... )' syntax
;;   - comments `(?# ... )'

;;   Most of the more esoteric PCRE features can't really be supported by
;;   simple translation to Elisp regexps. These include the different
;;   lookaround assertions, conditionals, and the \"backtracking control
;;   verbs\" `(* ...)' . OTOH, there are a few other syntaxes which are
;;   currently unsupported and possibly could be:

;;   - `\\L', `\\U', `\\l', `\\u' case modifiers
;;   - `\\g{...}' backreferences


;; 3.2 Other limitations
;; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

;;   - The order of alternatives and characters in char classes sometimes
;;     gets shifted around, which is annoying.
;;   - Although the string parser tries to interpret PCRE's octal and
;;     hexadecimal escapes correctly, there are problems with matching
;;     8-bit characters that I don't use enough to properly understand,
;;     e.g.:
;;     ,----
;;     | (string-match-p (rxt-pcre-to-elisp \"\\\\377\") \"\\377\") => nil
;;     `----
;;     A fix for this would be welcome.

;;   - Most of PCRE's rules for how `^', `\\A', `$' and `\\Z' interact with
;;     newlines are not implemented, since they seem less relevant to
;;     Emacs's buffer-oriented rather than line-oriented model. However,
;;     the different meanings of the `.' metacharacter *are* implemented
;;     (it matches newlines with the `/s' flag, but not otherwise).

;;   - Not currently namespace clean (both `rxt-' and a couple of `pcre-'
;;          functions).


;; 3.3 TODO:
;; ~~~~~~~~~

;;   - PCRE forward- and backward-search (easy)
;;   - PCREs in isearch mode (not so easy)
;;   - Python-specific extensions to PCRE?
;;   - Language-specific stuff to enable regexp font-locking and explaining
;;     in different modes. Each language would need two functions, which
;;     could be kept in an alist:

;;     1. A function to read PCRE regexps, taking the string syntax into
;;        account. E.g., Python has single-quoted, double-quoted and raw
;;        strings raw strings with different quoting rules. PHP has the
;;        kind of belt-and-suspenders solution you would expect: regexps
;;        are in strings, /and/ you have to include the `/ ... /'
;;        delimiters! Duh.

;;     2. A function to copy faces back from the parsed string to the
;;        original buffer text. This has to recognize any escape sequences
;;        so they can be treated as a single character.


;; 4 Internal details
;; ==================

;;   Internally, `rxt' defines an abstract syntax tree data type for
;;   regular expressions, parsers for Elisp and PCRE syntax, and
;;   \"unparsers\" from to PCRE, rx, and SRE syntax. Converting from a parsed
;;   syntax tree to Elisp syntax is a two-step process: first convert to
;;   `rx' form, then let `rx-to-string' do the heavy lifting. See
;;   `rxt-parse-re', `rxt-adt->pcre', `rxt-adt->rx', and `rxt-adt->sre',
;;   and the section beginning \"Regexp ADT\" in pcre2el.el for details.

;;   This code is partially based on Olin Shivers' reference SRE
;;   implementation in scsh, although it is simplified in some respects and
;;   extended in others. See `scsh/re.scm', `scsh/spencer.scm' and
;;   `scsh/posixstr.scm' in the `scsh' source tree for details. In
;;   particular, `pcre2el' steals the idea of an abstract data type for
;;   regular expressions and the general structure of the string regexp
;;   parser and unparser. The data types for character sets are extended in
;;   order to support symbolic translation between character set
;;   expressions without assuming a small (Latin1) character set. The
;;   string parser is also extended to parse a bigger variety of
;;   constructions, including POSIX character classes and various Emacs and
;;   Perl regexp assertions. Otherwise, only the bare minimum of scsh's
;;   abstract data type is implemented.


;; 5 Soapbox
;; =========

;;   Emacs regexps have their annoyances, but it is worth getting used to
;;   them. The Emacs assertions for word boundaries, symbol boundaries, and
;;   syntax classes depending on the syntax of the mode in effect are
;;   especially useful. (PCRE has `\\b' for word-boundary, but AFAIK it
;;   doesn't have separate assertions for beginning-of-word and
;;   end-of-word). Other things that might be done with huge regexps in
;;   other languages can be expressed more understandably in Elisp using
;;   combinations of `save-excursion' with the various searches (regexp,
;;   literal, skip-syntax-forward, sexp-movement functions, etc.). IMHO, of
;;   course ;-)

;;   There's not much percentage in using `rxt-pcre-to-elisp' to put PCREs
;;   in a Lisp program you're going to maintain, since you still have to
;;   double all the backslashes. Better to just use the converted result
;;   (or better yet the `rx' form ;-)


;; 6 History
;; =========

;;
;; This package extends option and argument completion of shell
;; commands read by Emacs.  It is intended to make shell completion in
;; Emacs comparable to the rather excellent completion provided by
;; both Bash and Zsh.
;;
;; This package uses `pcomplete' to define completion handlers which
;; are used whenever shell completion is performed.  This includes
;; when commands are read in the minibuffer via `shell-command' (M-!)
;; or in `shell-mode'.
;;
;; Completion support is provided for many different commands
;; including:
;;
;;   - GNU core utilities (ls, rm, mv, date, sort, cut, printf, ...)
;;
;;   - Built-in shell commands (if, test, time, ...)
;;
;;   - Various GNU/Linux commands (find, xargs, grep, man, tar, ...)
;;
;;   - Version control systems (bzr, git, hg, ...)
;;

;; Installation:
;;
;; To use this package, save `pcmpl-args.el' to your `load-path' and
;; add the following to your `init.el':
;;
;;     (require 'pcmpl-args)
;;
;; Note: This package uses `lexical-binding' so it probably will not
;; work with older versions of Emacs (prior to 24.1).
;;
;; Note: This package redefines the following functions:
;;
;;   `pcomplete/bzip2'
;;   `pcomplete/chgrp'
;;   `pcomplete/chown'
;;   `pcomplete/gdb'
;;   `pcomplete/gzip'
;;   `pcomplete/make'
;;   `pcomplete/rm'
;;   `pcomplete/rmdir'
;;   `pcomplete/tar'
;;   `pcomplete/time'
;;   `pcomplete/which'
;;   `pcomplete/xargs'
;;

;; Defining new completion commands:
;;
;; This package contains a number of utilities for defining new
;; pcomplete completion commands:
;;
;; `pcmpl-args-pcomplete'
;;      Can be used to define completion for commands that have
;;      complex option and argument parsing.
;;
;; `pcmpl-args-pcomplete-on-help'
;;      Completion via parsing the output of `COMMAND --help'.
;;
;; `pcmpl-args-pcomplete-on-man'
;;      Completion via parsing the output of `man COMMAND'.

;; pcache provides a persistent way of caching data, in a hashtable-like
;; structure. It relies on `eieio-persistent' in the backend, so that any
;; object that can be serialized by EIEIO can be stored with pcache.

;; pcache handles objects called \"repositories\" (`pcache-repository') and
;; \"entries\" (`pcache-entry'). Each repository is identified by a unique name,
;; that defines an entry in `pcache-directory'. Subdirectories are allowed, by
;; the use of a directory separator in the repository name.

;; Example:
;; (let ((repo (pcache-repository \"plop\")))
;;   (pcache-put repo 'foo 42) ; store value 42 with key 'foo
;;   (pcache-get repo 'foo) ; => 42

;; Keys can be pretty much any Lisp object, and are compared for equality using
;; `eql'

;; Optionally, cache entries can expire:
;; (let ((repo (pcache-repository \"plop\")))

;;
;;  To use this library:
;;
;;    Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;      (require 'palette) ; Load this library.
;;      M-x palette
;;
;;    You will also need my library `hexrgb.el'; it is loaded
;;    automatically by `palette.el'.  Get it here:
;;    http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/hexrgb.el.
;;
;;  After loading, use command `palette' to display a color palette in
;;  Color Palette mode (`palette-mode').  This has three sub-palettes
;;  (from left to right):
;;
;;   - a hue x saturation palette - buffer Palette (Hue x Saturation).
;;     Hue is horizontal; saturation is vertical.  Hue is the tint of
;;     a color, independent of its brightness and grayness.
;;     Saturation is the purity of a color (opposite of grayness).
;;
;;   - a color-swatch palette - buffer Current/Original
;;
;;   - a value (brightness) palette - buffer Brightness
;;
;;  The color-swatch palette shows the current color and the original
;;  color or the last color saved.  Saving is not persistent.
;;
;;  In the color palette:
;;
;;   - `.' shows info about the current color
;;   - `mouse-1' or `?' shows info about a color at pointer or cursor
;;   - `mouse-2' or `RET' anywhere picks a color as the current color
;;   - Cursor motion is along the grid of colors, with wrapping.
;;     Shifted cursor motion updates the current color as you move.
;;   - `n', `C-s' saves the current color
;;   - `o', `C-o' restores the old (saved) color
;;   - `l', `u' swaps the current color and the last color (undo)
;;   - `c', `M-c' picks a color by name or RGB hex string
;;   - `M-h' picks a color by HSV components (decimal)
;;   - `M-r' picks a color by RGB components (decimal)
;;   - `~' picks the complement of the current color
;;   - `r', `g', `b', `h', `s', `v' decreases the red, green, blue,
;;     hue, saturation, value  component of the current color,
;;     respectively; `R', `G', `B', `H', `S', `V' increases the
;;     component
;;   - `q' quits the palette
;;   - `C-l' refreshes the palette: use if you have a display problem
;;   - `C-h m' provides info on Color Palette mode
;;
;;  Some things to keep in mind when using the Color Palette:
;;
;;  * \"Hue\" means tint; \"saturation\" means color purity or intenseness
;;    (opposite of grayness); and \"value\" means brightness.
;;    Saturation=0 is grayscale; saturation=1 is pure color (no gray).
;;    Value=0 is black (no light); value=1 is as bright as possible
;;    (100% color).
;;
;;  * Hue 0.0 and hue 1.0 are the same: pure red.  The hue x
;;    saturation palette shows this discontinuity.  Move the cursor
;;    horizontally near the right side of this palette and you will
;;    see the hue value jump between 0.0 and 1.0 at a certain point.
;;
;;  * The value (brightness) of the current color is indicated by a
;;    horizontal bar in the Brightness palette (far right).
;;
;;  * Whenever you input a color name, you can use completion against
;;    the list of all recognized colors.  If you also use my library
;;    Icicles, then you can match any part(s) of the color name.
;;
;;  * Color names supported by your Emacs release and platform are
;;    those returned by function `x-color-names'.  This often includes
;;    names that are essentially the same, as duplicates,
;;    e.g. \"LightBlue\" and \"light blue\".  By default, the Color
;;    Palette canonicalizes these names by lowercasing them and
;;    removing whitespace.  Then it removes duplicates.  This behavior
;;    is governed by option `hexrgb-canonicalize-defined-colors-flag'.
;;    Customize that option to nil if you need the original, names.
;;
;;  * You can at any time use an RGB hexadecimal color string in place
;;    of a recognized color name.  An RGB string has the form
;;    #XXXXXXXXXXXX, where each X is a hex digit (the # is optional
;;    for input).  The number of Xs must be 12 or less and a multiple
;;    of 3, with the same number of Xs for each of red, green, and
;;    blue.  Examples: #FF0099 (red: FF, green: 00, blue: 99),
;;    #0C1FA329E (red: 0C1, green: FA3, blue: 29E).
;;
;;  * For output, that is, messages and some return values, an RGB
;;    value respects user option `palette-hex-rgb-digits', which
;;    determines the number of hex digits (1 to 4) per RGB component.
;;
;;  * Once you find a color you like, you can use its RGB string
;;    anywhere in Emacs as the color definition of a face or a frame.
;;    Its RGB string is the value of `palette-current-color'.
;;
;;  * The palette should appear in its own, small frame - on my
;;    screen, the frame is about 9cm x 13cm (inside dimensions).  If
;;    the palette appears much larger than that, or if it looks weird,
;;    then your font is probably too large.  In that case, customize
;;    option `palette-font' - see it for more information.  Here is a
;;    screenshot of how the palette should appear:
;;    http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ColorPalette.el.
;;
;;  * By default, information about the color at any location is only
;;    available upon demand, by clicking `mouse-1' or `mouse-2', or
;;    hitting `?' or `RET'.  If you prefer additional feedback, set
;;    option `palette-verbose-flag' to non-nil to display color
;;    information each time you move the cursor, pick a color, or
;;    modify a color swatch.  This can slow things down a bit, because
;;    it means additional computation of color components.
;;
;;  * The cursor is positioned in each of the windows so that it
;;    corresponds as well as possible to the other windows.  However,
;;    this correspondance is by no means exact, because of the nature
;;    of conversion betwen RGB and HSV color spaces.  In particular,
;;    the color in the main Palette buffer (`Hue x Saturation') does
;;    not necessarily reflect the current color accurately.  If you
;;    want information about the current color, then use `.', not `?',
;;    or use `?' from the color-swatch window.
;;
;;  * The commands that increase and decrease individual RGB
;;    components (r, g, b, R, G, B) are sometimes unintuitive.  If you
;;    set `palette-verbose-flag' to non-nil and then watch the RGB
;;    feedback in the echo area, these commands will make more sense.
;;    Because the palette displays colors as hue x saturation, RGB
;;    components are converted to the closest HSV components in the
;;    palette.  Increasing an RGB component does not automatically
;;    decrease the other RGB components, so, for instance, increasing
;;    red will not necessarily move directly toward the red area of
;;    the palette.  Just as for HSV component changes (cursor
;;    movements), RGB component changes cycle when you reach one end.
;;    For intance, when you decrease red past 0 it wraps around to 1.
;;
;;  * Non-nil `palette-update-cursor-color-flag' updates the frame
;;    foreground and cursor color dynamically, so that the position of
;;    the current color stands out well against the palette.  For
;;    example, if the current color is red then the foreground color
;;    becomes cyan.  The default value is nil.  When nil, you cannot
;;    see the black cursor against a black background.  When non-nil,
;;    there are two annoyances: 1) updating the cursor color causes
;;    redisplay of the frame, which is slow; 2) If you ask for
;;    information about a color that is very different from the
;;    current color, then it still might be difficult to see the
;;    cursor because of its color.  In that case, you can hit `RET' to
;;    make it the current color so its position stands out better.
;;    (Hit `l' to undo).
;;
;;  * You can at any time toggle options `palette-verbose-flag' and
;;    `palette-update-cursor-color-flag' with keys `f' (for
;;    \"feedback\") and `e' (for \"enhanced cursor color\").
;;
;;  * By default, feedback about a color includes its RGB hex string,
;;    RGB decimal components, and HSV decimal components.  If your
;;    minibuffer is too short for all of that info, or if you are
;;    interested in only some of it, then you can change the value of
;;    user option `palette-message-info' accordingly.  In addition,
;;    you can use commands `palette-hex-info', `palette-hsv-info',
;;    `palette-rgb-info' at any time to obtain only color information
;;    of one type.
;;
;;  * I am interested in suggestions for improving the interactive
;;    response.  You will find that the color palette is usable, but
;;    some palette operations can be slow.  This is due to using Emacs
;;    faces to display the colors: 10000 faces are used just for the
;;    100x100 color hue x saturation palette.  Emacs faces are, so
;;    far, not designed to be used this way (many at a time).  An
;;    alternative design would be to use an image instead of
;;    characters with faces.  I am not interested in such a design,
;;    however, at least for now.  I want to push the face envelope.
;;
;;  * If you call `palette' from Emacs-Lisp code, you can use various
;;    hook functions to do something with the latest color value.  See
;;    `palette-change-color-hook', `palette-exit-hook',
;;    and`palette-save-color-hook'.  This gives you a way to react to
;;    user palette actions.
;;
;;  ** Eye Dropper and `eyedropper.el' **
;;
;;  You can at any time, from any Emacs window, pick up the foreground
;;  or background color at the current cursor position (point),
;;  setting `palette-picked-background' or`palette-picked-foreground',
;;  as well as `palette-current-color', to it.  Use commands
;;  `eyedropper-foreground' and `eyedropper-background' to do this.
;;  You can then set any Emacs face or frame color using the value of
;;  `palette-current-color'.  With a prefix argument (`C-u'), these
;;  commands also display the color palette.
;;
;;  Library `palette.el' is a superset of the functionality provided
;;  by library `eyedropper.el'.  If you use Emacs 22 or later, then
;;  you can use `palette.el' instead of `eyedropper.el'; `palette.el'
;;  will satisfy all of the requirements by any other libraries that
;;  require `eyedropper.el'.  It does this via (provide 'eyedropper)
;;  and by providing aliases for all of the `eyedropper.el' functions
;;  and variables.  If for some reason you do load both libraries,
;;  then load `palette.el' after `eyedropper.el'.
;;
;;  ** Use with Icicles **
;;
;;  If you use this library with Icicles (`icicles.el' and associated
;;  files), which I recommend, then `c' is bound in the palette to an
;;  Icicles multi-command that lets you choose colors by name.  After
;;  you hit `c', you can hit `TAB' or `S-TAB' to use Icicles
;;  completion.  During completion, you can use `C-next', `C-prior',
;;  `C-down', `C-up', and `C-RET' to change the current color to
;;  different colors, by name, successively.  This lets you browse
;;  colors by name, seeing what they look like immediately.
;;
;;  ** Do Re Mi **
;;
;;  See also my library `doremi-frm.el' to incrementally adjust face
;;  and frame properties, including colors, using the arrow keys or a
;;  mouse wheel.  The color changes are applied instantly to the
;;  face(s) or frames, so you see the result as you make the changes.

"]) (pabbrev . [(20130923 1257) nil "Predictive abbreviation expansion" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; The code provides a abbreviation expansion for Emacs.  Its fairly
;; similar to \"dabbrev\" expansion, which works based on the contents
;; of the current buffer (or other buffers).
;;
;; Predictive abbreviation expansion works based on the previously
;; written text.  Unlike dynamic abbreviation, the text is analysed
;; during idle time, while Emacs is doing nothing else.  `pabbrev-mode'
;; tells you when this is happening.  If this irritates you unset
;; `pabbrev-idle-timer-verbose'.  The advantage of this is that its
;; very quick to look up potential abbreviations, which means that the
;; can be constantly displayed, without interfering with the user as
;; they type.  Certainly it works for me, on an old laptop, typing as
;; fast as I can (which is fast, since I learnt to type with four
;; fingers).
;;
;; pabbrev's main entry point is through the minor mode
;; `pabbrev-mode'.  There is also a global minor mode, called
;; `global-pabbrev-mode', which does the same in all appropriate
;; buffers.
;;
;; The current user interface looks like so...
;; 
;; p[oint]
;; pr[ogn]
;; pre[-command-hook]
;; pred[ictive]
;;
;; As the user types the system narrows down the possibilities.  The
;; narrowing is based on how many times the words have been used
;; previously.  By hitting [tab] at any point the user can complete the
;; word.  The [tab] key is normally bound to `indent-line'.
;; `pabbrev-mode' preserves access to this command (or whatever else
;; [tab] was bound to), if there is no current expansion. 
;;
;; Sometimes you do not want to select the most commonly occurring
;; word, but a less frequently occurring word.  You can access this
;; functionality by hitting [tab] for a second time.  This takes you
;; into a special suggestions buffer, from where you can select
;; secondary selections.  See `pabbrev-select-mode' for more
;; details. There is also an option `pabbrev-minimal-expansion-p'
;; which results in the shortest substring option being offered as the
;; first replacement.
;;
;; But is this actually of any use? Well having use the system for a
;; while now, I can say that it is sometimes.  I originally thought
;; that it would be good for text, but in general its not so
;; useful.  By the time you have realised that you have an expansion
;; that you can use, hit tab, and checked that its done the right
;; thing, you could have just typed the word directly in.  It's much
;; nicer in code containing buffers, where there tend to be lots of
;; long words, which is obviously where an abbreviation expansion
;; mechanism is most useful.
;;
;; Currently pabbrev builds up a dictionary on a per major-mode basis.
;; While pabbrev builds up this dictionary automatically, you can also
;; explicitly add a buffer, or a region to the dictionary with
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-buffer', or `pabbrev-scavenge-region'.  There is
;; also a command `pabbrev-scavenge-some' which adds some words from
;; around point.  pabbrev remembers the word that it has seen already,
;; so run these commands as many times as you wish.
;;
;; Although the main data structures are efficient during typing, the
;; pay off cost is that they can take a reasonable amount of time, and
;; processor power to gather up the words from the buffer.  There are
;; two main settings of interest to reduce this, which are
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-some-chunk-size' and
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-on-large-move'.  `pabbrev-mode' gathers text from
;; around point when point has moved a long way.  This means symbols
;; within the current context should be in the dictionary, but it can
;; make Emacs choppy, in handling.  Either reduce
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-some-chunk-size' to a smaller value, or
;; `pabbrev-scavenge-on-large-move' to nil to reduce the effects of
;; this.
;;
;; NOTE: There are a set of standard conventions for Emacs minor
;; modes, particularly with respect to standard key bindings, which
;; pabbrev somewhat abuses.  The justification for this is that the
;; whole point of pabbrev mode is to speed up typing.  Access to its
;; main function has to be on a very easy to use keybinding.  The tab
;; seems to be a good choice for this.  By preserving access to the
;; original tab binding when there is no expansion, pabbrev mostly
;; \"does what I mean\", at least in my hands.

;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; Visibility cycling
;; ------------------
;;
;; The command `outline-cycle' changes the visibility of text and headings
;; in the buffer.  Instead of using many different commands to show and
;; hide buffer parts, `outline-cycle' cycles through the most important
;; states of an outline buffer.  In the major `outline-mode', it will be
;; bound to the TAB key.  In `outline-minor-mode', the user can choose a
;; different keybinding.  The action of the command depends on the current
;; cursor location:
;;
;; 1. When point is at the beginning of the buffer, `outline-cycle'
;;    cycles the entire buffer through 3 different states: 
;;      - OVERVIEW: Only top-level headlines are shown.
;;      - CONTENTS: All headlines are shown, but no body text.
;;      - SHOW ALL: Everything is shown.
;;
;; 2. When point in a headline, `outline-cycle' cycles the subtree started
;;    by this line through the following states:
;;      - FOLDED:   Only the headline is shown.
;;      - CHILDREN: The headline and its direct children are shown.  From
;;                  this state, you can move to one of the children and
;;                  zoom in further.
;;      - SUBTREE:  The entire subtree under the heading is shown.
;;
;; 3. At other positions, `outline-cycle' jumps back to the current heading.
;;    It can also be configured to emulate TAB at those positions, see
;;    the option `outline-cycle-emulate-tab'.
;;
;; Structure editing
;; -----------------
;;
;; Four commands are provided for structure editing.  The commands work on
;; the current subtree (the current headline plus all inferior ones). In
;; addition to menu access, the commands are assigned to the four arrow
;; keys pressed with a modifier (META by default) in the following way:
;;
;;                                 move up
;;                                    ^
;;                        promote  <- | ->  demote 
;;                                    v
;;                                move down
;;
;; Thus, M-left will promote a subtree, M-up will move it up
;; vertically throught the structure.  Configure the variable
;; `outline-structedit-modifiers' to use different modifier keys.
;;
;; Moving subtrees
;; - - - - - - - -
;; The commands `outline-move-subtree-up' and `outline-move-subtree-down'
;; move the entire current subtree (folded or not) past the next same-level
;; heading in the given direction.  The cursor moves with the subtree, so
;; these commands can be used to \"drag\" a subtree to the wanted position.
;; For example, `outline-move-subtree-down' applied with the cursor at the
;; beginning of the \"* Level 1b\" line will change the tree like this:
;;
;;   * Level 1a                         * Level 1a        
;;   * Level 1b         ===\\            * Level 1c  
;;   ** Level 2b        ===/            * Level 1b  
;;   * Level 1c                         ** Level 2b   
;;
;; Promotion/Demotion
;; - - - - - - - - - -
;; The commands `outline-promote' and `outline-demote' change the current
;; subtree to a different outline level - i.e. the level of all headings in
;; the tree is decreased or increased.  For example, `outline-demote'
;; applied with the cursor at the beginning of the \"* Level 1b\" line will
;; change the tree like this:
;;
;;   * Level 1a                         * Level 1a        
;;   * Level 1b         ===\\            ** Level 1b  
;;   ** Level 2b        ===/            *** Level 2  
;;   * Level 1c                         * Level 1c   
;;
;; The reverse operation is `outline-promote'.  Note that the scope of
;; \"current subtree\" may be changed after a promotion.  To change all
;; headlines in a region, use transient-mark-mode and apply the command to
;; the region.
;;
;; NOTE: Promotion/Demotion in complex outline setups
;; - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
;; Promotion/demotion works easily in a simple outline setup where the
;; indicator of headings is just a polymer of a single character (e.g. \"*\"
;; in the default outline mode).  It can also work in more complicated
;; setups.  For example, in LaTeX-mode, sections can be promoted to
;; chapters and vice versa.  However, the outline setup for the mode must
;; meet two requirements:
;;
;; 1. `outline-regexp' must match the full text which has to be changed
;;    during promotion/demotion.  E.g. for LaTeX, it must match \"\\chapter\"
;;    and not just \"\\chap\".  Major modes like latex-mode, AUCTeX's
;;    latex-mode and texinfo-mode do this correctly.
;;
;; 2. The variable `outline-promotion-headings' must contain a sorted list
;;    of headings as matched by `outline-regexp'.  Each of the headings in
;;    `outline-promotion-headings' must be matched by `outline-regexp'.
;;    `outline-regexp' may match additional things - those matches will be
;;    ignored by the promotion commands.  If a mode has multiple sets of
;;    sectioning commands (for example the texinfo-mode with
;;    chapter...subsubsection and unnumbered...unnumberedsubsubsec), the
;;    different sets can all be listed in the same list, but must be
;;    separated by nil elements to avoid \"promotion\" accross sets.
;;    Examples:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook      ; or 'LaTeX-mode-hook for AUCTeX
;;     (lambda ()
;;       (setq outline-promotion-headings
;;             '(\"\\\\chapter\" \"\\\\section\" \"\\\\subsection\"
;;               \"\\\\subsubsection\" \"\\\\paragraph\" \"\\\\subparagraph\"))))
;;
;;    (add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook
;;     (lambda ()
;;      (setq outline-promotion-headings
;;       '(\"@chapter\" \"@section\" \"@subsection\" \"@subsubsection\" nil
;;         \"@unnumbered\" \"@unnumberedsec\" \"@unnumberedsubsec\" 
;;                                       \"@unnumberedsubsubsec\" nil
;;         \"@appendix\" \"@appendixsec\" \"@appendixsubsec\"
;;                                         \"@appendixsubsubsec\" nil
;;         \"@chapheading\" \"@heading\" \"@subheading\" \"@subsubheading\"))))
;;
;;    If people find this useful enough, maybe the maintainers of the
;;    modes can be persuaded to set `outline-promotion-headings'
;;    already as part of the mode setup. 
;;
;;  Compatibility:
;;  --------------
;;  outline-magic was developed to work with the new outline.el
;;  implementation which uses text properties instead of selective display.
;;  If you are using XEmacs which still has the old implementation, most

;; This package helps Emacs run Safari, Google Chrome, and Firefox
;; on OS X.  It is similar to the built-in `browse-url', but is
;; somewhat more friendly and configurable.
;;
;; The foreground/background behavior of the external browser can
;; be controlled via customizable variables and prefix arguments.
;; A positive prefix argument forces foreground; a negative prefix
;; argument forces background.  With no prefix argument, the
;; customizable variable setting is respected.
;;
;; Default values for URLs or search text are deduced from the region
;; or from context around the point, according to the heuristics in
;; browse-url-dwim.el.
;;
;; To use osx-browse, place the osx-browse.el library somewhere

;;
;;     This library uses browse-url-dwim.el, but does not require that
;;     `browse-url-dwim-mode' be turned on.  If both modes are turned
;;     on, keybindings from both modes will be active.
;;
;;     When `osx-browse-mode' is turned on, `browse-url-browser-function'
;;     is set to `osx-browse-url', meaning that your default browsing
;;     facilities will be provided by this library.  `osx-browse-url-safari'
;;     and friends are provided in the event that you wish to set
;;     `browse-url-browser-function' by hand.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.4-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.2           : yes, with some limitations
;;     GNU Emacs version 21.x and lower : unknown
;;
;;     Requires: browse-url-dwim.el
;;
;;     Uses if present: string-utils.el
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     `osx-browse-prefer-background' is only respected on
;;     interactive calls.
;;
;;     Keybindings don't work out of the box with Aquamacs, which
;;     does not think that \342\214\230 is the Super modifier.
;;
;;     OS X makes an iconified application visible, even when opening
;;     a URL in the background.
;;
;;     New-window parameter is not respected, just as in browse-url.el
;;     Could use AppleScript as follows
;;
;;         osascript -e 'tell application id \"com.apple.Safari\" to make new document with properties {URL:\"%s\"}'
;;
;;         osascript -e 'tell application id \"com.google.Chrome\"' -e 'set win to make new window' -e 'set URL of active tab of win to \"%s\"' -e 'end tell'
;;
;;         there should be a similar AppleScript solution for Firefox
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Respect new-window parameter.
;;
;;     If new-window worked, could make two universal prefix args
;;     mean: foreground + new window.
;;

;; * Using org-readme
;; Org readme is used to:
;; 
;; - Create/Update a \"History\" section in the Readme.org based on the changelog
;;   section of the Emacs Log.
;; - Create/Update a \"Library Information\" Section Based on the Emacs lisp header.
;; - Create/Update a \"Possible Dependencies\" Section Based on the Emacs
;;   lisp header.
;; - Create/Update a \"Functions\" Section based on the functions defined
;;   in the single lisp library.
;; - Create/Update a \"Variables\" Section based on the variables defined
;;   in the single lisp library.
;; 
;; All other sections of the Readme.org are then put into the
;; \"Commentary\" section of the readme.org.
;; 
;; In addition this library defines `org-readme-sync',  a convenience function that:
;; 
;; - Asks for a commentary about the library change.
;;   - To exit/save press `C-c C-c'
;; - Asks if this is a minor revision
;;   - If it is a minor revision, bumps the revision up so the new
;;     library will be posted to marmalade-repo.org
;;   - The package will attempt to add the readme to the info
;;     documentation system within emacs.
;; - Syncs the Readme.org with the lisp file as described above.
;; - Updates emacswiki with the library description and the library
;;   itself (requires yaoddmuse).
;; - Updates Marmalade-repo if the library version is different than the
;;   version in the server (requires http-post-simple).
;; - Updates the git repository with the differences that you posted.
;; - If you are using github, this library creates a melpa recipie.
;; - If you are using github, this library creates a el-get recipie. 
;; 
;; When `org-readme-sync' is called in a `Readme.org' file that is not a
;; single lisp file, the function exports the readme in EmacsWiki format
;; and posts it to the EmacsWiki.
;; ** EmacsWiki Page Names
;; EmacsWiki Page names are generated from the file.  `org-readme.el'

;; * Introduction:
;; Org mode lets you organize your tasks. However, sometimes you may wish
;; to integrate org-mode with outlook since your company forces you to
;; use Microsoft Outlook.  [[file:org-outlook.el][org-outlook.el]] allows: 
;; - Creating Tasks from outlook items:
;;   - org-outlook-task. All selected items in outlook will be added to a
;;     task-list at current point. This version requires org-protocol and   
;;     org-protocol.vbs.  The org-protocol.vbs has can be generated with
;;     the interactive function `org-outlook-create-vbs'.
;; 
;; - Open Outlook Links in org-mode
;; 
;;   - Requires org-outlook-location to be customized when using Outlook
;;     2007 (this way you don\342\200\231t have to edit the registry).
;; 
;; This is based loosely on:
;; http://superuser.com/questions/71786/can-i-create-a-link-to-a-specific-email-message-in-outlook
;; 
;; 
;; Note that you may also add tasks using visual basic directly. The script below performs the following actions:
;; 
;;    - Move email to Personal Folders under folder \"@ActionTasks\" (changes GUID)
;;    - Create a org-mode task under heading \"* Tasks\" for the file `f:\\Documents\\org\\gtd.org'
;;    - Note by replacing \"@ActionTasks\", \"* Tasks\" and
;;      `f:\\Documents\\org\\gtd.org' you can modify this script to your
;;      personal needs.
;; 
;; The visual basic script for outlook is:
;; 
;; 
;;

;; - magit:/path/to/repo::commit@<hash>

;; - magit:/path/to/repo::log

;; Of course those links can be stored as usual with `org-store-link' from the

;; `directory-abbrev-alist' for configuring its behavior. Alternately, you can
;; customize `org-magit-filename-transformer' and provide your own
;; transformer function.

;; When exporting those links, the variable `org-magit-known-public-providers'

;; http server that is able to expose those objects.

;; Certain settings can be configured directly at the repository level
;; if needed. For example

;; org-mac-message.el written by John Wiegley and Christopher
;; Suckling.
;;
;; Detailed comments for each application interface are inlined with
;; the code.  Here is a brief overview of how the code interacts with
;; each application:
;;
;; Finder.app - grab links to the selected files in the frontmost window
;; Mail.app - grab links to the selected messages in the message list
;; AddressBook.app - Grab links to the selected addressbook Cards
;; Firefox.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Vimperator/Firefox.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Safari.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Google Chrome.app - Grab the url of the frontmost tab in the frontmost window
;; Together.app - Grab links to the selected items in the library list
;; Skim.app - Grab a link to the selected page in the topmost pdf document
;; Microsoft Outlook.app - Grab a link to the selected message in the message list
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; add (require 'org-mac-link) to your .emacs, and optionally bind a
;; key to activate the link grabber menu, like this:
;;
;; (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;   (define-key org-mode-map (kbd \"C-c g\") 'org-mac-grab-link)))
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Type C-c g (or whatever key you defined, as above), or type M-x
;; org-mac-grab-link RET to activate the link grabber.  This will present
;; you with a menu to choose an application from which to grab a link
;; to insert at point.  You may also type C-g to abort.
;;
;; Customizing:
;;
;; You may customize which applications appear in the grab menu by
;; customizing the group `org-mac-link'.  Changes take effect
;; immediately.

;; org-fstree inserts the filesystem subtree for a given directory.
;; Each file/directory is formatted as a headline, provides links back 
;; to all headlines that are associated with it (by containing links to the file) 
;; and is assigned their tags.
;;
;; Installation:
;;   - put this file into your load-path 
;;   - insert \"(require 'org-fstree)\" into ~/.emacs
;;
;; Usage:
;;   - enter a line containing \"#+BEGIN_FSTREE: <dir>\" into an org buffer, 
;;     where <dir> is the directory, that is to be inserted.
;;   - while the cursor is in the line mentioned, press \"C-c C-c\"
;;
;; Options:
;;   Specify options in the form:
;;   \"#+BEGIN_FSTREE: <dir> :<optionname1> <optionvalue1> :<optionname2> <optionvalue2>  ...
;;   Options are:
;;     - :non-recursive t , to suppress recursion into directories
;;     - :exclude-regexp-name <list of regexp strings> , exclude file/directory names matching either 
;;                                                  of the given regexp expressions
;;       Examples: 
;;         :exclude-regexp-name (\".*\\\\.pdf$\" \".*\\\\.zip$\"), excludes files/directories ending with either \".pdf\" or \".zip\"
;;         :exclude-regexp-name (\"^\\\\.git$\") , excludes files/directories named \".git\"
;;
;;     - :exclude-regexp-fullpath <list of regexp strings>, same as :exclude-regexp-name but matches absolute path to file/directory
;;     - :relative-links t , generates relative instead of absolute links
;;     - :show-only-matches t , only files that are being linked to show up
;;     - :only-directories t , only directories are listed
;;     - :only-regular-files t , only regular files are listed

;;
;; Bitcoin donations gratefully accepted: 1Ph9srQBspJCDS9CnGUyWJPTrU4ydX9Aa3
;;
;; Keeping your emacs config in an org file makes it easier for you to keep your .emacs under control,
;; and avoid DotEmacsBankruptcy.
;; With your config code stored in an org file you can easily edit the structure and keep notes.
;; 
;; This library allows you to load elisp code from an org file on emacs startup.
;; You can also limit the code that is loaded to certain tagged headers using an org tag match,
;; and specify dependencies between code blocks.
;; Using tag matches you can also reuse the same org file for different emacs setups by specifying different
;; tag matches for each setup, or load parts of the file on demand.
;; 
;;; Commands/Usage 
;; 
;; The main command is `org-dotemacs-load-default' which loads your default org-dotemacs file (~/.dotemacs.org)
;; and prompts for a tag match to specify which code blocks to load. 
;; In this way you can load bits of config code when you need them.
;; 
;; You can also put this command in your InitFile (see Installation below) to load the code on startup.
;; To change the default org file use the `org-dotemacs-default-file' option.
;; If you want to load a different org file from your default one, use `org-dotemacs-load-file'.
;; 
;; For faster loading you may prefer to keep your config code in a separate elisp file, and just update this file now and again
;; by exporting the code from the org file.
;; Use the `org-dotemacs-load-file' command for this and specify a target file when prompted.
;; 
;;; Structure of the org file 
;; 
;; The elisp code should be contained in emacs-lisp code blocks, e.g:
;; 
;; #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; (setq line-number-mode t)
;; (setq column-number-mode t)
;; (setq frame-title-format \"%b\")
;; (set-background-color \"Black\")
;; (set-foreground-color \"White\")
;; (set-cursor-color \"White\")
;; #+END_SRC
;; 
;; Ideally you should have each code block under a separate org subtree, then you can use properties to
;; name the blocks and define dependencies, and tags and todo states to specify which blocks
;; should be loaded (see below).
;; 
;; I prefer to keep all my code block subtrees under a single header, and use other headers for keeping notes,
;; defining buffer-wide properties, etc. This way I can get a nice column view of the code blocks
;; (see the columns view section below).
;; 
;;;  Block dependencies 
;; 
;; You can enforce dependencies between code blocks by defining NAME & DEPENDS properties for the subtrees containing the
;; blocks (preferred). The NAME property should contain the name of the block, and the DEPENDS property should contain a space
;; separated list of block names that this block depends on.
;; These properties will be applied to all code blocks in the subtree (see \"Properties and Columns\" in the org manual for
;; more details).
;; 
;; The NAME property can be overridden on a per block basis by adding a :name header arg to a block, and dependencies can be
;; augmented by adding a :depends header arg (see \"Header arguments\" in the org manual).
;; However it is recommended to keep a separate subtree for each code block and use properties for defining headers and names
;; since then you can get a column view of the dependencies (see below).
;; 
;; A block will not be loaded until all of its dependencies have been loaded.
;; 
;;;  Tags and TODO states 
;; 
;; You can tag your subtrees and use tag matches to specify which blocks to evaluate in calls to `org-dotemacs-load-file'
;; and `org-dotemacs-load-default'. See \"Matching tags and properties\" in the org manual for more information on tag matches.
;; 
;; Also, by default any blocks in a subtree marked with a todo state of BROKEN will not be evaluated.
;; You can specify which TODO states to include/exclude for evaluation by customizing the `org-dotemacs-include-todo' and
;; `org-dotemacs-exclude-todo' options.
;; 
;; To add the BROKEN state to the list of todo states for the file you need to add buffer-wide todo states by adding a line
;; like this somewhere in your org file (see \"Per file keywords\" in the org manual).
;; 
;; #+TODO: BROKEN CHECK TODO
;; 
;;;  Columns View 
;; 
;; If you use properties for defining names and dependencies then you can get a nice column view of your code subtrees
;; with the following columns view specification:
;; 
;; #+COLUMNS: %35ITEM %15NAME %35DEPENDS %15TAGS %TODO
;; 
;; This can be placed anywhere in your dotemacs org file.
;; Then if you press C-c C-x C-c on the toplevel header for your code blocks you'll get a column view that allows you
;; to easily change the names, dependencies, tags and todo states.
;; 
;;;  Error handling 
;; 
;; Error handling can be controlled by customizing `org-dotemacs-error-handling' or by setting the error-handling
;; command line option when starting emacs.
;; By default code blocks with unmet dependencies or errors are skipped over as soon as an error is encountered,
;; but you can also specify that org-dotemacs should halt or try to reload the blocks.
;; In the latter case each time a new block is successfully loaded, any unsuccessful blocks will be retried.
;; 
;;;  Command line options 
;; 
;; org-dotemacs.el will look for two command line options when loaded: error-handling (for setting the value of
;; `org-dotemacs-error-handling') and tag-match (for specifying which headers to load).
;; For example if you enter the following at the command line:
;; 
;;        emacs --error-handling retry --tag-match \"settings-mouse\"
;; 
;; Then only code blocks tagged \"settings\" but not \"mouse\" will be loaded, and org-dotemacs will try to reload any
;; blocks that have errors.
;; 
;;;  Installation 
;; 
;; Put org-dotemacs.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;; 
;; Then make sure you have an ~/.dotemacs.org file and add the following lines to
;; the end of your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (load-file \"~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el\")
;; (org-dotemacs-load-default)
;; 
;; or if you want to just load code blocks matching a tag match:
;; 
;; (load-file \"~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el\")
;; (org-dotemacs-load-default \"<TAG-MATCH>\")
;; 
;; To load a different org file either customize `org-dotemacs-default-file' or use the
;; `org-dotemacs-load-file' function, e.g:
;; 
;; (load-file \"~/.emacs.d/org-dotemacs.el\")
;; (org-dotemacs-load-file \"~/.emacs.d/my_emacs_config.org\" \"<TAG-MATCH>\")

;;
;;    Frame configuration that uses one frame per window.
;;
;;  This library is part of One-on-One Emacs, a collection of
;;  libraries that try to make Emacs more frame-oriented and less
;;  window-oriented.
;;
;;  This library sets up Emacs to use multiple frames: individual
;;  frames are used, by default, instead of Emacs windows.  That is,
;;  the default is to use a frame for each Emacs window: one window on
;;  one frame.
;;
;;  You can configure each of the frames defined here.
;;
;;  Default properties are defined here for normal frames and
;;  \"special\" frames, which show \"special-display buffers\" (see Emacs
;;  manual for info on such frames).
;;
;;  In addition, these user options control the creation of three
;;  separate, specialized frames:
;;
;;    - `1on1-*Help*-frame-flag' - *Help* buffer frame
;;    - `1on1-*Completions*-frame-flag' - *Completions* buffer frame
;;    - `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' - minibuffer frame
;;
;;  Buffers *Help* and *Completions* are always displayed in their own
;;  frames.  In addition, if `1on1-*Help*-frame-flag' or
;;  `1on1-*Completions*-frame-flag' is non-nil, then the *Help* or
;;  *Completions* frame has a special (customizable) appearance.
;;
;;  If `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil (the default value),
;;  then the minibuffer is shown in its own frame,
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame'; this is the only frame to have a
;;  minibuffer.  If you customize `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' to nil,
;;  then each frame will have its own minibuffer, as usual, and there
;;  will be no standalone minibuffer frame.
;;
;;  By default, if you use a standalone minibuffer frame, it is
;;  automatically sized to the full width of your display and placed
;;  at the bottom of the display.
;;
;;  If `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil,
;;  `1on1-minibuffer-frame-flag' is non-nil, and you also use library
;;  `fit-frame.el', then, whenever the minibuffer is active, the
;;  minibuffer frame height is automatically adjusted to fit its
;;  content after each command or user event (e.g. each key press).
;;  Options `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height' and
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame-max-height-percent' define the maximum
;;  possible height for this behavior.  In addition, if you bind
;;  `1on1-fit-minibuffer-frame' to a key (I use `C-o'), then you can
;;  use that key repeatedly to increase the height by one line, even
;;  beyond the maximum.
;;
;;  To help you perceive changes to different minibuffer recursion
;;  levels, the background color of the minibuffer frame is changed
;;  slightly with each recursion-depth change.
;;
;;  This library is especially useful if used in combination with
;;  One-on-One Emacs libraries `autofit-frame.el', which automatically
;;  fits frames to their sole window, and `fit-frame.el', which lets
;;  you fit a frame to its selected window manually.  Library
;;  `autofit-frame.el' uses library `fit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  Because Emacs is not really designed to be frame-oriented, there
;;  are many built-in and standard functions that produce
;;  less-than-optimal results when frames, instead of windows, are the
;;  default.  In other One-on-One Emacs libraries, I have fixed most
;;  of these built-in functions to play well with frames.
;;
;;  For more information on One-on-One Emacs see
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/OneOnOneEmacs.
;;
;;  To use this library, put the following at the *END* of your init
;;  file, `.emacs' (or `_emacs').  In particular, if your init file
;;  contains a `custom-set-variables' expression, then the following
;;  must appear *AFTER* that expression, in order for this to take
;;  into account your customizations of any `1on1-' user options.
;;
;;    (require 'oneonone)
;;    (1on1-emacs)
;;
;;  Initial frame: By default, the initial Emacs frame is like all
;;  other normal (non-special-display) frames; that is,
;;  `initial-frame-alist' effectively uses the frame properties
;;  defined in `default-frame-alist'.  If you would like the initial
;;  frame to be different, set `default-frame-alist' to nil after
;;  requiring `oneonone.el' but before executing `1on1-emacs':
;;
;;    (require 'oneonone)
;;    (setq default-frame-alist nil)
;;    (setq initial-frame-alist '((background-color . \"White\"))); e.g.
;;    (1on1-emacs)
;;
;;  If you want the text cursor to change to a box when Emacs is idle,
;;  then add this line also to your init file:
;;
;;    (toggle-box-cursor-when-idle 1) ; Turn on box cursor when idle.
;;
;;  Info and Customize frames: I recommend that you put the following
;;  code in your init file, so that Info and Customize buffers will
;;  display in their own frames.  Which code to use depends on your
;;  version of GNU Emacs.
;;
;;    (cond ((< emacs-major-version 21)

;;
;;  Notes on user options defined here:
;;  ---------------------------------
;;
;;  Some user options are used here only as conveniences to define
;;  frame-parameter alists.  They are defined using `defvar', not
;;  `defcustom', because you cannot use Customize to define them
;;  independently of the alist user options they help to define.  The
;;  alists themselves are the variables to customize.  If you want to
;;  change the `defvar' variables individually and then use them to
;;  set the alist variables, then use `setq', not Customize, to change
;;  them, and restart Emacs for their changes to take effect.
;;
;;  Changes to any user options defined here with `defcustom' will
;;  take effect as soon as `1on1-emacs' is executed, so you can do
;;  `M-x 1on1-emacs' to see their changes (no need to restart
;;  Emacs).
;;
;;  User options `1on1-color-minibuffer-frame-on-setup-increment' and
;;  `1on1-color-minibuffer-frame-on-exit-increment' determine how much
;;  to change the color of the minibuffer frame when the minibuffer is
;;  entered and exited.  They are hue increments, and should be
;;  opposite in sign.
;;
;;  They should cancel each other out, so that the color returns to
;;  what it was initially at any given minibuffer depth.  However,
;;  because of the way HSV and RGB color-component conversion works,
;;  the best cancellation does not necessarily occur when these
;;  options have the same absolute value.  And how much their absolute
;;  values should differ depends on that magnitude.  It is best to
;;  just set one of these to an increment you like, and then fiddle
;;  with the other until they more or less cancel.

"]) (on-screen . [(20131212 1954) nil "guide your eyes while scrolling" single ";;; Commentary:

;; Scrolling can be distracting because your eyes may lose
;; orientation.  This library implements a minor mode that highlights
;; the previously visible buffer part after each scroll.
;;
;; Installation: Put this library somewhere in your load-path, or
;; install via M-x package-list-packages.  Then add to your init-file:
;;
;;   (require 'on-screen)
;;
;; To invoke on-screen globally for all buffers, also add
;;
;;   (on-screen-global-mode +1)
;;
;; Alternatively you can use the buffer local version `on-screen-mode'.
;; For example, add this line to your init file:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'Info-mode-hook 'on-screen-mode)
;;
;; to enable it in all Info buffers.
;;
;; By default, fringe markers are used for highlighting - see
;; `on-screen-highlight-method' to change that.  Type M-x
;; customize-group RET on-screen RET to see what else can be
;; configured.  If you use a configuration file (.emacs), you may also
;; want to define mode specific settings by using buffer local
;; variables.  For example, to use non intrusive fringe markers by
;; default, but transparent overlays in w3m, you would add
;;
;;   (add-hook
;;    'w3m-mode-hook
;;    (lambda ()
;;      (set (make-local-variable 'on-screen-highlight-method)
;;       'shadow)))
;;
;; to your .emacs.
;;
;; If you use transparent overlays for highlighting and there is the
;; library \"hexrgb.el\" in your `load-path', it will be used to compute
;; highlighting colors dynamically instead of using constant faces.
;; I.e. if you use non-default background colors (e.g. from custom
;; themes), on-screen will try to perform highlighting with a
;; suitable, slightly different color.  See
;; `on-screen-highlighting-to-background-delta' to control this.
;;
;;
;; Implementation notes (mainly for myself):
;;
;; Implementing this functionality is not as straightforward as one
;; might think.  There are commands that scroll other windows than the
;; current one.  Not only scrolling commands can scroll text - also
;; editing or even redisplay can cause windows to scroll.  There is
;; weird stuff such as folding and narrowing, influencing the visible
;; buffer part.  And although highlighting is realized in the
;; displayed buffers (with overlays), it must be organized on a
;; per-window basis, because different buffer parts may be displayed
;; in different windows, and their highlightings must not interfere.
;;
;; That all makes it necessary to observe windows via hacks in
;; different hooks, and to manage information about buffers, visible
;; parts and timers in a data structure (`on-screen-data').  It is
;; realized as an association list whose keys are windows.  There are
;; some pitfalls - e.g. the data can be out of date if the window
;; configuration has changed and windows display different buffers
;; now.  The data must be updated, but not simply be thrown away,
;; because the highlightings in the old buffers must be removed
;; nonetheless.

;; occur-x.el adds some extra functionality to occur-mode.  It allows the
;; user to refine any occur mode with extra regexp based filters.  Use
;; commands `occur-x-filter-out' and `occur-x-filter' to add positive and
;; negative filters.  By default those commands are bind to keys \"f\" and
;; \"k\" (from flush and keep).  Use command `occur-x-undo-filter' to remove
;; filters.  Filters are kept if the buffer is reverted (shortcut \"g\") or
;; cloned (shortcut \"c\").

;; Another useful addition of occur-x to occur-mode is the possibility to
;; displaying the line numbers in the margin of your choice, instead of
;; \"inside\" the occur buffer.  This way every match line in the occur
;; buffer is exactly the same as in the original buffer.  Customize
;; variable `occur-linenumbers-in-margin' and face `occur-margin-face' to
;; your liking.  When displayed in the margin, line numbers won't interfere
;; with the regexps of the additional filters.

;;; Usage

;; This is oauth client library implementation in elisp. It is
;; capable of authenticating (receiving an access token) and signing
;; requests. Currently it only supports HMAC-SHA1, although adding
;; additional signature methods should be relatively straight forward.

;; Visit http://oauth.net/core/1.0a for the complete oauth spec.

;; Oauth requires the client application to receive user authorization in order
;; to access restricted content on behalf of the user. This allows for
;; authenticated communication without jeopardizing the user's password.
;; In order for an application to use oauth it needs a key and secret
;; issued by the service provider.

;; Usage:

;; Obtain access token:

;; The easiest way to obtain an access token is to call (oauth-authorize-app)
;; This will authorize the application and return an oauth-access-token.
;; You will use this token for all subsequent requests. In many cases
;; it will make sense to serialize this token and reuse it for future sessions.
;; At this time, that functionality is left to the application developers to
;; implement (see yammer.el for an example of token serialization).

;; Two helper functions are provided to handle authenticated requests:
;; (oauth-fetch-url) and (oauth-post-url)
;; Both take the access-token and a url.
;; Post takes an additional parameter post-vars-alist which is a
;; list of key val pairs to be used in a x-www-form-urlencoded message.

;; yammer.el:
;; http://github.com/psanford/emacs-yammer/tree/master is an example
;; mode that uses oauth.el

;; Dependencies:

;; The default behavior of oauth.el is to dispatch to curl for http
;; communication. It is strongly recommended that you use curl.
;; If curl is unavailable you can set oauth-use-curl to nil and oauth.el
;; will try to use the emacs internal http functions (url-request).
;; Note: if you plan on doing https and have oauth-use-curl set to nil,
;; make sure you have gnutls-bin installed.

;; oauth.el uses hmac-sha1 library for generating signatures. An implementation
;; by Derek Upham is included for convenience.

;; This library assumes that you are using the oauth_verifier method
;; described in the 1.0a spec.

;; list:

;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'nav-flash)
;;
;;     (nav-flash-show)
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Nav-flash temporarily highlights the line containing the point,
;; which is sometimes useful for orientation after a navigation
;; command.
;;
;; To use nav-flash, place the nav-flash.el library somewhere Emacs
;; can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'nav-flash)
;;
;; There is no user-level interface for this library; it is only used
;; by other Lisp libraries.  However, you might find it useful to call
;; `nav-flash-show' in your ~/.emacs file.  For example, the following
;; hook causes a flash to appear after navigating via imenu:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'imenu-after-jump-hook 'nav-flash-show nil t)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET nav-flash RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET pulse RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library reuses a timer and overlay defined in compile.el,
;;     but should not affect the normal use of compile.el / `next-error'.
;;
;;     Pulse.el provides similar functionality and is included with
;;     Emacs.  This library can use pulse.el, but does not do so by
;;     default, because pulse.el uses `sit-for', breaking this type
;;     of construction:
;;
;;         (nav-flash-show)
;;         (with-temp-message \"message here\"
;;            (sit-for 2))
;;
;;     When using an overlay and timer for cleanup (as nav-flash does
;;     by default) the flash and message appear simultaneously.
;;
;;     Nav-flash.el is also simpler than pulse.el.

;;
;;  Lets you use key-sequence descriptions that do not bother with
;;  angle brackets: `<' and `>'.
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 21, vanilla GNU Emacs did not bother with angle
;;  brackets either, but someone around the turn of the century got
;;  the idea that Emacs could not do without them.  So instead of the
;;  `delete' key we now have the `<delete>' key.  And instead of`C-x
;;  M-delete' we now have `C-x M-<delete>'.  \"On n'arrete pas le
;;  progres !\"
;;
;;  Angle brackets are not needed - why?  Because we already use
;;  spaces to separate keys in a key-sequence description (we use
;;  `SPC' to indicate the SPACE key).
;;
;;  To be fair, it is true that sometimes people have taken the
;;  shortcut when writing about user input of writing, e.g., `M-x
;;  forward-char RET' instead of writing `M-x f o r w a r d - c h a
;;  r'. And if you write `forward' that way to stand for an input
;;  sequence of seven chars, then you cannot also expect `forward' to
;;  stand for a function key named `forward', can you?
;;
;;  Well, yes you can, if the context makes things clear enough.  And
;;  I for one find `C-M-<insert>' butt-ugly (likewise `<C-M-insert>')
;;  - and, more importantly, insulting to Occam and his razor.
;;
;;  So go ahead and go NaKeD - shed your angles.
;;
;;  Here's what you need.  It won't completely purge Emacs from
;;  insulting you with the occasional pair of angle brackets, but it
;;  at least lets you DTRT in code that you write:
;;
;;  * Use function `naked-key-description' instead of
;;    `key-description'.
;;
;;    The former outputs naked key descriptions: no angle brackets
;;    around function keys.  E.g., if KEY is the sequence of events
;;    produced by holding the Shift key while hitting the Insert key,
;;    then `(naked-key-description KEY)' returns \"S-insert\" (and not
;;    \"S-<insert>\").  (Internally, this sequence of events is the
;;    vector [S-insert].)
;;
;;  * Use function `naked' instead of `kbd' (which is a function
;;    starting with Emacs 24.3 and a macro before then).
;;
;;    The former allows its argument key-sequence description to use
;;    naked keys, not clothed in angle brackets.  E.g., (naked
;;    \"C-M-delete\") has the same effect as (kbd \"C-M-<delete>\").
;;
;;  * Use command `naked-read-kbd-macro' instead of `read-kbd-macro'.
;;
;;  * Use function `naked-edmacro-parse-keys' instead of
;;    `edmacro-parse-keys' (if you happen to use that lower-level
;;    function).
;;
;;  But you can also have it both ways if or when you might need to:
;;  All of these accept an optional argument ANGLES which, if
;;  non-`nil', returns the behavior to the vanilla one, expecting
;;  function keys to be fully clothed in angle brackets.  E.g.: (naked
;;  \"C-M-<delete>\" t).
;;
;;  In addition, even without an non-nil ANGLES argument, function
;;  `naked' does the right thing for keys expressed using angle
;;  brackets.  IOW, (naked \"M-<foobar>\") returns the same thing that
;;  (naked \"M-foobar\") does: [M-foobar].
;;
;;  Enjoy!

;;
;; This package is for creating and managing multiple terminal buffers in Emacs.
;;
;; By default, term.el provides a great terminal emulator in Emacs.
;; But I have some troubles with term-mode:
;;
;; 1. term.el just provides commands `term' or `ansi-term'
;;    for creating a terminal buffer.
;;    And there is no special command to create or switch
;;    between multiple terminal buffers quickly.
;;
;; 2. By default, the keystrokes of term.el conflict with global-mode keystrokes,
;;    which makes it difficult for the user to integrate term.el with Emacs.
;;
;; 3. By default, executing *NIX command \342\200\234exit\342\200\235 from term-mode,
;;    it will leave an unused buffer.
;;
;; 4. term.el won\342\200\231t quit running sub-process when you kill terminal buffer forcibly.
;;
;; 5. Haven\342\200\231t a dedicated window for debug program.

"]) (mouse3 . [(20131227 142) nil "Customizable behavior for `mouse-3'." single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library lets you customize the behavior of `mouse-3' in
;; several ways.
;;
;; It redefines standard command `mouse-save-then-kill' in a trivial
;; way to give you custom behavior for a second `mouse-3' click at the
;; same spot.
;;
;; Vanilla Emacs hard-wires the behavior to kill or delete the region
;; (depending on the value of `mouse-drag-copy-region').  That action
;; can be handy, but it is sometimes inappropriate (e.g., in a
;; read-only buffer).  In any case, it is only one possible action;
;; there are often other actions on the selected text that you might
;; want to take instead.
;;
;; The redefined `mouse-save-then-kill' command in `mouse3.el' just
;; uses function `mouse3-second-click-command' to handle a second
;; click at the same spot.  That function returns the command that
;; `mouse-save-then-kill' invokes: either the command that is the
;; value of variable `mouse3-save-then-kill-command' or, if that is
;; nil the command that is the value of user option
;; `mouse3-second-click-default-command'.
;;
;; Special contexts can bind variable `mouse3-save-then-kill-command'
;; to provide particular behavior.  For example, Icicles does this
;; during minibuffer completion so that a second `mouse-3' at the same
;; spot in buffer `*Completions*' marks the selected completions
;; (saves them for later reuse).
;;
;; You can use option `mouse3-second-click-default-command' to
;; customize the behavior to either pop up a menu or invoke any
;; command you choose.  The default value is
;; `mouse3-region-popup-menu', which pops up a menu.  To obtain the
;; vanilla Emacs behavior, customize the option value to command
;; `mouse3-kill/delete-region'.
;;
;; Option `mouse3-double-click-command' associates a command with a
;; `mouse-3' double-click.  The default value is command
;; `mouse3-kill/delete-region', so with the default setup you can kill
;; or delete the selected text by double-clicking `mouse-3' instead of
;; single clicking.  In other words, in the default setup you have two
;; possibilities:
;;
;;  2nd single-click: Pop up a menu so you can choose how to act on
;;                    the selected text.
;;
;;  double-click:     Kill or delete the selection, according to
;;                    standard option `mouse-drag-copy-region'.
;;
;; If you choose to customize one of these two options,
;; `mouse3-second-click-default-command' or
;; `mouse3-double-click-command', then you will probably want to
;; customize both of them.
;;
;; To make either a single-click or a double-click do nothing,
;; customize the appropriate option to the command `ignore'.
;;
;; Note:
;;
;; I do not recommend that you try reversing the option values from
;; their defaults, so that a double-click pops up a menu and the
;; second single-click at the same spot deletes the selected text.
;; That does not work well in general because of a flaw (or a feature,
;; depending on your view) in the Emacs design.
;;
;; Here's the problem: When you double-click to get the menu, Emacs
;; first sends a single-click event, before the double-click event.
;; (That's the flaw/feature.)  So if you double-click at the same spot
;; then the selection is first deleted, before the menu pops up.
;;
;; If you double-click at a different spot then this does not happen,
;; but instead the selection is extended or reduced to match the
;; double-click position.  The selection might then not be the region
;; you want the menu items to act on.  Things work pretty well,
;; however, if you start selecting by double-clicking `mouse-1', click
;; `mouse-3' here and there to extend, and finally double-click
;; `mouse-3' near the end of the selection, because in that case the
;; double-click position does not extend the selection any more.
;;
;; In sum, in general I do not recommend that you reverse the default
;; values.  If you want `mouse-3' to pop up a menu, it is better to
;; either (a) use the default setup so that the menu pops up on the
;; second single-click, not on a double-click or (b) let
;; `mouse3-double-click-command' pop up the menu, but set
;; `mouse3-second-click-default-command' to a command other than
;; `mouse3-kill/delete-region'.
;;
;;
;; Customized Pop-Up Menu
;; ----------------------
;;
;; If you choose for `mouse-3' to pop up a menu then you can customize
;; that menu using various user options.  The command that pops up the
;; menu is `mouse3-region-popup-menu'.  See the documentation for that
;; command for more explanation of the use of options.
;;
;; A fairly complete default menu is provided out of the box, so you
;; do not need to customize anything unless you want to.
;;
;; `mouse3-region-popup-menu' ultimately invokes standard function
;; `x-popup-menu' to do its work.  The menu definition used by
;; `x-popup-menu' can take two alternative forms which are quite
;; different.  Which form you choose to use is controlled by option
;; `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag'.
;;
;; If that option is nil (the default value), you can use keymaps and
;; extended menu items to define the popup menu.  This is recommended.
;; If the value is non-nil then you can use option
;; `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' to make use of the alternative,
;; `x-popup-menu'-specific form.
;;
;; That alternative form is easy to use, but it does not offer you all
;; of the possibilities that a standard menu definition does.  In
;; particular, it does not let you provide keywords such as `:visible'
;; and `:enable' that control the display and makeup of submenus and
;; menu items.  Examples of both methods are provided in this file.
;;
;; The default behavior takes advantage of keywords to dynamically
;; remove or disable submenus and menu items that are inappropriate
;; for the current context.  For example, it removes or disables
;; buffer-modifying items and submenus if the current buffer is
;; read-only, and it removes or disables region-related items and
;; submenus when the region is empty.
;;
;; The rest of the description here assumes that
;; `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag' is nil (the default value
;; and recommended).
;;
;; You can optionally include, at the beginning of the menu, a submenu
;; that has, as its own submenus, the global menus that are currently
;; available.  (These are the same menus that are popped up by
;; `C-mouse-3'.)  This is controlled by option
;; `mouse3-region-popup-include-global-menus-flag'.  If the menu bar
;; is not shown currently, then these submenus are the menu-bar menus.
;; Otherwise they are the major-mode menus.
;;
;; For example, if the menu bar is showing, then in Dired mode the
;; first submenu is `Dired by name', which itself has submenus
;; `Operate', `Mark', `Regexp', `Immediate', and `Subdir'.
;;
;; You define the rest of the popup menu (other than the global part)
;; using submenu keymaps and `menu-item' bindings (extended menu
;; items).  You do this by customizing option
;; `mouse3-region-popup-entries'.  You can reuse existing keymaps or
;; create menu items and submenus from scratch.  See the documentation
;; for `mouse3-region-popup-entries'.  If you reuse existing keymaps
;; you can add their menu items either as a submenu or as individual
;; items.
;;
;;
;; Mode-Specific Popup Menu
;; ------------------------
;;
;; You can provide mode-specific behavior by either replacing the
;; default `mouse-3' popup menu or augmenting it with mode-specific
;; entries.
;;
;; `mouse3.el' provides useful behavior for Dired mode.  You can do
;; the same for other modes you use.  Simple example code is also
;; provided here for Picture mode.  The menu implementation for these
;; two modes is different, to give you an idea of what is possible.
;; For Dired mode, `mouse3-region-popup-entries' is used.  For Picture
;; mode, `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' is used, and both
;; `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes-flag' and
;; `mouse3-region-popup-x-popup-panes' are made buffer-local.
;;
;; The example code for Picture mode provides actions on the rectangle
;; defined by the region: items such as `Draw Rectangle' and `Clear
;; Rectangle'.
;;
;; Let's look at the behavior for Dired mode in more detail.  The
;; vanilla Emacs behavior just raises an error, because Dired is
;; read-only.  Why not let a second `mouse-3' click at the same spot
;; do something wrt the selected file and dir names?  Two obvious
;; possibilities come to mind: toggle whether each file/dir is marked,
;; or pop up a menu that lets you act in various ways on each of the
;; selected files and dirs.
;;
;; Option `mouse3-dired-function' lets you choose between these two
;; behaviors.  The default value is `mouse3-dired-use-menu', which
;; means to pop up a menu.  This is just like the default popup menu
;; except that it has an additional submenu, `Selected Files', that is
;; Dired-specific.  The first submenu is the global major-mode menu,
;; `Dired by name'.  The second, `Selected Files', has items that act
;; on the files and directories that are selected (in the region):
;;
;;  `Mark'
;;  `Unmark'
;;  `Toggle Marked/Unmarked'
;;  `Flag for Deletion'
;;  `Stop Using Menu'
;;
;; That last item just switches from having `mouse-3' pop up a menu to
;; having it toggle the markings of the selected files (the
;; alternative behavior of `mouse3-dired-function').
;;
;; If you also use library Dired+ (`dired+.el'), which I recommend,
;; then that last menu item is not present, and when the region is
;; empty you get a different popup menu which pertains only to the
;; file where you clicked `mouse-3'.
;;
;;
;; Context-Specific Behavior (for Emacs-Lisp Programmers)
;; ------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; As mentioned above, Icicles provides an example of a program
;; imposing context-specific behavior for the second `mouse-3' click
;; at the same spot.  The context in this case is (a) completion and
;; (b) clicking in buffer `*Completions*'.  For that, Icicles sets a
;; buffer-local value of variable `mouse3-save-then-kill-command'.
;;
;; If you write Emacs-Lisp code, note that this is an example where
;; the text is a set of entries in tabular format (columns).  Each
;; `*Completions*' entry (candidate) is defined by its `mouse-face'
;; property, not by its text.  For example, it is not delimited by
;; whitespace (completion candidates can contain spaces and newlines).
;; A context-specific function picks up the set of selected
;; completions as a list.
;;
;; Similar opportunities can exist for other tabular or line-list
;; data: `*Buffer List*', compile/grep output, Info breadcrumbs,...
;; Use your imagination.  The Dired example is typical here: the
;; region sweeps out text linearly, but the only thing we are really
;; interested in are the file and subdirectory names that are inside
;; the region.

;;
;;  Command `mouse-flash-position' highlights the character after the
;;  mouse pointer position, even as you drag it.  This can help make
;;  it clearer exactly where a `yank' will occur when you use
;;  `mouse-2'.  When you press `mouse-2', if the highlighted position
;;  is not exactly what you want, just keep `mouse-2' held while you
;;  move to the right location.  To enable this behavior, bind
;;  `mouse-flash-position' to `down-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-flash-position-or-M-x' is the same thing as
;;  `mouse-flash-position', except that it has a special behavior in
;;  the echo area (that is, the minibuffer space when the minibuffer
;;  is inactive).  In the echo area, it calls `M-x'.  To enable this
;;  behavior, bind `mouse-flash-position-or-M-x' to `down-mouse-2'.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-scan-lines' tracks the mouse position, highlighting
;;  the line at that position.  It is handy in buffers like Dired that
;;  are essentially tables with columns - it helps you to align
;;  entries that are in the same row.
;;
;;  Command `mouse-scan-lines-or-M-:' is the same thing as
;;  `mouse-scan-lines', except that it has a special behavior in the
;;  echo area.  In the echo area, it calls `M-:'.  To enable this

;;
;;  See also library `second-sel.el' for enhancements to

;;     instead of the buffer size, whenever the region is active.
;;
;;  More precisely for #2: When the region is active, the mode line
;;  displays some information that you can customize - see option
;;  `modelinepos-style'.  Customization choices for this include (a)
;;  the number of chars, (b) the number of chars and number of lines,
;;  and (c) anything else you might want.  Choice (b) is the default.
;;
;;  For (c), you provide a `format' expression as separate components:
;;  the format string and the sexp arguments to be evaluated and
;;  plugged into the string.  The number of sexp args depends on the
;;  format string that you use: one for each `%' construct.
;;
;;  Choice (c) is provided so that you can choose alternative
;;  formatting styles.  For example, instead of ` 256 ch, 13 l', you
;;  could show ` (256 chars, 13 lines)'.  But (c) can really show
;;  information at all.  It need not have anything to do with the
;;  region, but it is nevertheless shown when the region is active.
;;
;;  Option `modelinepos-empty-region-flag' determines whether to show

;;{{{ Parameter Naming

;;; Since version 0.3.7, I've tried to use a uniform scheme for naming
;;; parameters. Here's a brief summary.

;;; BEG and END refer to the beginning and end of a region.
;;; FRONT and BACK refer to the respective delimiters of a region.
;;; FRONT- and BACK-OFFSET are the offsets from delimiter matches.
;;; FRONT-BEG through BACK-END are the endings of the delimiters.
;;; START and STOP bound actions, like searching, fontification, etc.

;;}}}
;;{{{ CL and Parameters

;;; Keyword parameters can be nice because it makes it easier to see
;;; what's getting passed as what. But I try not to use them in user
;;; functions, because CL doesn't make good documentation strings.
;;; Similarly, any hook or callback function can't take keywords,
;;; since Emacs as a whole doesn't use them. And for small parameter
;;; lists, they are overkill. So I use them only for a large number of
;;; optional parameters, such as `mmm-make-region'.

;;; An exception is the various submode class application functions,
;;; which all take all their arguments as keywords, for consistency
;;; and so the classes alist looks nice.

;;; When using keyword arguments, defaults should *always* be supplied
;;; in all arglists. (This pertains mostly to :start and :stop
;;; arguments, usually defaulting to (point-min) and (point-max)
;;; respectively.) `mmm-save-keywords' should only be used for lists
;;; with more than four arguments, such as in `mmm-ify-by-regexp'.

;;; In general, while I have no qualms about using things from CL like
;;; `mapl', `loop' and `destructuring-bind', I try not to use `defun*'
;;; more than I have to. For one, it sometimes makes bad documentation
;;; strings. Furthermore, to a `defun'ned function, a nil argument is
;;; the same as no argument, so it will use its (manual) default, but
;;; to a `defun*'ned function, a nil argument *is* the argument, so
;;; any default specified in the arglist will be ignored. Confusion of
;;; this type should be avoided when at all possible.

;; Subsequent invocations of this command cause the window displaying
;; the *Completions* buffer to scroll, if necessary.
;; 
;; This library advises the `minibuffer-complete' command so that
;; subsequent invocations instead select each of the possible
;; completions in turn, inserting it into the minibuffer and
;; highlighting it in the *Completions* buffer.  As before, the window
;; displaying the possible completions is scrolled if necessary.  This
;; feature is enabled by loading this file and setting the
;; `minibuffer-complete-cycle' option to t with `M-x customize-variable'
;; or `M-x set-variable'; it is disabled by unsetting the option (to
;; nil).  Besides t, the special value `auto' enables the feature and
;; also causes the first completion to be selected immediately.
;; 
;; You can also customize the `minibuffer-complete-cycle' face, which is
;; used to highlight the selected completion, with `M-x customize-face'
;; or any of the `M-x set-face-' commands.

;; The technique of deleting the minibuffer contents, then (for file

;; Short Description:
;;
;; Load this file, activate it and Emacs will display highlighting on
;; whatever parenthesis (and paired delimiter if you like this) matches
;; the one before or after point.  This is an extension to the paren.el
;; file distributed with Emacs.  The default behaviour is similar to
;; paren.el but more sophisticated.  Normally you can try all default
;; settings to enjoy mic-paren.
;;
;; Some examples to try in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
;;           (function (lambda ()
;;                       (paren-toggle-matching-quoted-paren 1)
;;                       (paren-toggle-matching-paired-delimiter 1))))
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
;;           (function (lambda ()
;;                        (paren-toggle-open-paren-context 1))))
;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Installation:
;;
;; o Place this file in a directory in your `load-path' and byte-compile
;;   it.  If there are warnings, please report them to ttn.
;; o Put the following in your .emacs file:
;;      (require 'mic-paren) ; loading
;;      (paren-activate)     ; activating
;;      ;;; set here any of the customizable variables of mic-paren:
;;      ;;; ...
;; o Restart your Emacs; mic-paren is now installed and activated!
;; o To list the possible customizations type `C-h f paren-activate' or
;;   go to the customization group `mic-paren-matching'.
;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Long Description:
;;
;; mic-paren.el is an extension and replacement to the packages paren.el
;; and stig-paren.el for Emacs.  When mic-paren is active Emacs normal
;; parenthesis matching is deactivated.  Instead parenthesis matching will
;; be performed as soon as the cursor is positioned at a parenthesis.  The
;; matching parenthesis (or the entire structured expression between the
;; parentheses) is highlighted until the cursor is moved away from the
;; parenthesis.  Features include:
;; o Both forward and backward parenthesis matching (simultaneously if
;;   cursor is between two expressions).
;; o Indication of mismatched parentheses.
;; o Recognition of \"escaped\" (also often called \"quoted\") parentheses.
;; o Option to match \"escaped\" parens too, especially in (La)TeX-mode
;;   (e.g., matches expressions like \"\\(foo bar\\)\" properly).
;; o Offers two functions as replacement for `forward-sexp' and
;;   `backward-sexp' which handle properly quoted parens (s.a.).  These
;;   new functions can automatically be bounded to the original binding
;;   of the standard `forward-sexp' and `backward-sexp' functions.
;; o Option to activate matching of paired delimiter (i.e., characters with
;;   syntax '$').  This is useful for writing in LaTeX-mode for example.
;; o Option to select in which situations (always, never, if match, if
;;   mismatch) the entire expression should be highlighted or only the
;;   matching parenthesis.
;; o Message describing the match when the matching parenthesis is off-screen
;;   (vertical and/or horizontal).  Message contains either the linenumber or
;;   the number of lines between the two matching parens.  Option to select in
;;   which cases this message should be displayed.
;; o Optional delayed highlighting (useful on slow systems),
;; o Functions to activate/deactivate mic-paren.el are provided.
;; o Numerous options to control the behaviour and appearance of
;;   mic-paren.el.
;;
;; mic-paren.el was originally developed and tested under Emacs 19.28 -
;; 20.3.  Since then, support for Emacs 19 and 20 has bit-rotted (not
;; dropped completely, but not tested against changes, either), and
;; will probably be removed without warning in a future version.  This
;; version was developed and tested under Emacs 23.0.60 (wip).  XEmacs
;; compatibility has been provided by Steven L Baur <steve@xemacs.org>.
;; Jan Dubois (jaduboi@ibm.net) provided help to get mic-paren to work in
;; OS/2.

;; IMPORTANT NOTES (important for people who have customized mic-paren
;;                  from within elisp):
;; - In version >= 3.3 the prefix \"mic-\" has been removed from the
;;   command-names `mic-paren-forward-sexp' and `mic-paren-backward-sexp'.
;;   Now all user-functions and -options begin with the prefix \"paren-\"
;;   because this package should be a replacement of the other
;;   paren-packages like paren.el and stig-paren.el!
;; - In version >= 3.2 the prefix \"mic-\" has been removed from the
;;   command-names `mic-paren-toggle-matching-quoted-paren' and
;;   `mic-paren-toggle-matching-paired-delimiter'.
;; - In versions >= 3.1 mic-paren is NOT auto-activated after loading.
;; - In versions >= 3.0 the variable `paren-face' has been renamed to
;;   `paren-match-face'.
;;
;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Versions:
;; v3.10   + Added message-length clamping (var `paren-max-message-length').
;;           Thanks to Jonathan Kotta.
;;
;; v3.9    + Fixed XEmacs bug in `define-mic-paren-nolog-message'.
;;           Thanks to Sivaram Neelakantan.
;;
;; v3.8    + Maintainership (crassly) grabbed by ttn.
;;         + License now GPLv3+.
;;         + Byte-compiler warnings eliminated; if you see one, tell me!
;;         + Dropped funcs: mic-char-bytes, mic-char-before.
;;         + Docstrings, messages, comments revamped.
;;
;; v3.7    + Removed the message \"You should be in LaTeX-mode!\".
;;         + Fixed a bug in `paren-toggle-matching-quoted-paren'.
;;         + Fixed some misspellings in the comments and docs.
;;
;; v3.6    + Fixed a very small bug in `mic-paren-horizontal-pos-visible-p'.
;;         + The informational messages like \"Matches ... [+28]\" which are
;;           displayed if the matching paren is offscreen, do not longer
;;           wasting the log.
;;
;; v3.5    + No mic-paren-messages are displayed if we are in isearch-mode.
;;         + Matching quoted parens is switched on if entering a minibuffer.
;;           This is useful for easier inserting regexps, e.g., with
;;           `query-replace-regexp'.  Now \\(...\\) will be highlighted
;;           in the minibuffer.
;;         + New option `paren-message-show-linenumber': You can determine
;;           the computation of the offscreen-message-linenumber.  Either the
;;           number of lines between the two matching parens or the absolute
;;           linenumber.  (Thank you for the idea and a first implementation
;;           to Eliyahu Barzilay <eli@cs.bgu.ac.il>.)
;;         + New option `paren-message-truncate-lines': If mic-paren messages
;;           should be truncated or not (has only an effect in GNU Emacs 21).
;;           (Thank you for the idea and a first implementation to Eliyahu
;;           Barzilay <eli@cs.bgu.ac.il>.)
;;
;; v3.4    + Corrected some bugs in the backward-compatibility for older
;;           Emacsen.  Thanks to Tetsuo Tsukamoto <czkmt@remus.dti.ne.jp>.
;;
;; v3.3    + Now the priority of the paren-overlays can be customized
;;           (option `paren-overlay-priority').  For a description of the
;;           priority of an overlay see in the emacs-lisp-manual the node
;;           \"Overlays\".  This option is mainly useful for experienced
;;           users which use many packages using overlays to perform their
;;           tasks.
;;         + Now you can determine what line-context will be displayed if
;;           the matching open paren is offscreen.  In functional
;;           programming languages like lisp it is useful to display the
;;           following line in the echo-area if the opening matching paren
;;           has no preceding text in the same line.
;;           But in procedural languages like C++ or Java it is convenient
;;           to display the first previous non empty line in this case
;;           instead of the following line.  Look at the new variable
;;           `paren-open-paren-context-backward' and the related toggling
;;           function `paren-toggle-open-paren-context' for a detailed
;;           description of this new feature.
;;         + In addition to the previous described new feature you can
;;           specify how a linefeed in the message (e.g., if the matching
;;           paren is offscreen) is displayed.  This is mainly because the
;;           standard echo-area display of a linefeed (^J) is bad to read.
;;           Look at the option `paren-message-linefeed-display'.
;;         + Solved a little bug in the compatibility-code for Emacsen
;;           not supporting current customize-feature.
;;         + Removed the prefix \"mic-\" from the commands
;;           `mic-paren-forward-sexp' and `mic-paren-backward-sexp'.
;;           For an explanation look at comments for version v3.2.
;;
;; v3.2    + The prefix \"mic-\" has been removed from the commands
;;           `mic-paren-toggle-matching-quoted-paren' and
;;           `mic-paren-toggle-matching-paired-delimiter'.  This is for
;;           consistency.  Now all user-variables, -faces and -commands
;;           begin with the prefix \"paren-\" and all internal functions
;;           and variables begin with the prefix \"mic-paren-\".
;;         + Now you can exactly specify in which situations the whole
;;           sexp should be highlighted (option `paren-sexp-mode'):
;;           Always, never, if match or if mismatch.  Tested with Gnus
;;           Emacs >= 20.3.1 and XEmacs >= 21.1.
;;
;; v3.1    + From this version on mic-paren is not autoloaded.  To
;;           activate it you must call `paren-activate' (either in your
;;           .emacs or manually with M-x).  Therefore the variable
;;           `paren-dont-activate-on-load' ise obsolet and has been
;;           removed.
;;         + Now mic-paren works also in older Emacsen without the
;;           custom-feature.  If the actual custom-library is provided
;;           mic-paren use them and is full customizable otherwise normal
;;           defvars are used for the options.
;;         + Fix of a bug displaying a message if the matching paren is
;;           horizontal out of view.
;;         + All new features are now tested with XEmacs >= 21.1.6.
;;
;; v3.0    + Checking if matching paren is horizontally offscreen (in
;;           case of horizontal scrolling).  In that case the message is
;;           displayed in the echo-area (anlogue to vertical offscreen).
;;           In case of horizontal offscreen closing parenthesis the
;;           displayed message is probably wider than the frame/window.
;;           So you can only read the whole message if you are using a
;;           package like mscroll.el (scrolling long messages) in GNU
;;           Emacs.
;;         + Now full customizable, means all user-options and -faces now
;;           can be set with the custom-feature of Emacs.  On the other
;;           hand, this means this version of mic-paren only works with an
;;           Emacs which provides the custom-package!
;;         + In case of the matching paren is offscreen now the displayed
;;           message contains the linenumber of the matching paren too.
;;         This version is only tested with Gnu Emacs >= 20.4 and not with
;;         any XEmacs!
;;         Implemented by Klaus Berndl <berndl@sdm.de>.
;;
;; v2.3    No additional feature but replacing `char-bytes' and
;;         `char-before' with `mic-char-bytes' and `mic-char-before' to
;;         prevent a clash in the global-namespace.  Now the new
;;         features of v2.1 and v2.2 are also tested with XEmacs!
;;
;; v2.2    Adding the new feature for matching paired delimiter.  Not
;;         tested with XEmacs.  Implemented by Klaus Berndl <berndl@sdm.de>
;;
;; v2.1    Adding the new feature for matching escaped parens too.  Not
;;         tested with XEmacs.  Implemented by Klaus Berndl <berndl@sdm.de>.
;;
;; v2.0    Support for MULE and Emacs 20 multibyte characters added.
;;         Inspired by the suggestion and code of Saito Takaaki
;;         <takaaki@is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp>.
;;
;; v1.9    Avoids multiple messages/dings when point has not moved.  Thus,
;;         mic-paren no longer overwrites messages in minibuffer.  Inspired by
;;         the suggestion and code of Barzilay Eliyahu <eli@cs.bgu.ac.il>.
;;
;; v1.3.1  Some spelling corrected (from Vinicius Jose Latorre
;;         <vinicius@cpqd.br> and Steven L Baur <steve@xemacs.org>).
;;
;; v1.3    Added code from Vinicius Jose Latorre <vinicius@cpqd.br> to
;;         highlight unmatched parentheses (useful in minibuffer).
;;
;; v1.2.1  Fixed stuff to work with OS/2 emx-emacs:
;;          - checks if `x-display-colour-p' is bound before calling it;
;;          - changed how X/Lucid Emacs is detected.
;;         Added automatic load of the timer-feature (plus variable to
;;         disable the loading).

;;    Extensions to `menu-bar.el'.  Redefines the default menu bar.
;;
;;  Usage:
;;
;;    This library should be loaded after loading standard library
;;    `menu-bar.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;
;;      (eval-after-load \"menu-bar\" '(require 'menu-bar+))
;;
;;    You will also want to do that before loading other libraries
;;    that might modify the following predefined menu-bar menus:
;;
;;      `File'
;;      `Edit'
;;      `More Manuals'
;;      `Options'
;;      `Search'
;;
;;    This is because those menus correspond to the variables
;;    mentioned at the end of this commentary as being REDEFINED here.
;;    If a library modifies one of those variables before you load
;;    `menu-bar+.el' then those changes will be lost when the variable
;;    is redefined.
;;
;;    The following libraries are exceptions to this rule.  If loaded
;;    before `menu-bar+.el' then they are used by `menu-bar+.el'.  So

"]) (mentor . [(20130519 1540) ((xml-rpc (1 6 9))) "Frontend for the rTorrent bittorrent client" tar ";;; Commentary:

;; mentor is a GNU Emacs frontend for the `rTorrent' bittorrent client.  It uses
;; XML-RPC to communicate with rTorrent, and needs rTorrent to be configured
;; accordingly.

;; This project aims to provide a feature complete and highly customizable
;; interface, which will feel familiar to Emacs users. Key bindings are chosen
;; to be as close to the vanilla rTorrent curses interface as possible.

;; mentor still has some way to go before it can really be considered a complete
;; interface, so please moderate your expectations. It works fine for many
;; common tasks though, and in some cases (dare we say?) much better than the
;; standard ncurses interface.

;; * QUICK START

;; Assuming you are installing mentor through MELPA, which is the recommended
;; way, here are some instructions to get you started. Otherwise, please see the
;; README.org file included in the repository for additional instructions.

;; 1. Add this to your init.el:
;;
;;    (require 'mentor)
;;    (setq mentor-rtorrent-url \"scgi://localhost:5000\")
;;
;;    Evaluate these lines or restart Emacs.
   
;; 2. Add this to your ~/.rtorrent.rc:
;;    
;;    scgi_port = 127.0.0.1:5000
;;    xmlrpc_dialect = i8
;;    encoding_list = UTF-8
;;    
;;    Make sure `scgi_port' matches `mentor-rtorrent-url' above. Restart rTorrent.

;; 3. To start mentor, run:
;;
;;    M-x mentor

;; ** ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION
;;
;; You can find Mentor in the `External' customize group.
;;
;;   M-x customize

;; ** CONFIGURING RTORRENT
;; 
;; For more information on configuring rTorrent, refer to:
;;
;; http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/wiki/RTorrentXMLRPCGuide

;; * KNOWN ISSUES

;; - The file view needs much love, and is currently not known to be
;;   working. Sorry.
;;
;; - There is no view for trackers/peers/extra information.
;;
;; - There is currently no support (patches welcome) for communicating with
;;   rtorrent over a local socket using the more secure scgi_local command. This
;;   means it is currently not advisable to use mentor on anything but single
;;   user systems.
;;
;; - mentor currently has some performance issues if you have many torrents
;;   (several hundreds). Be aware.

;; * CONTACT
;;
;; You can find the latest development version of mentor here:
;;
;; http://www.github.com/skangas/mentor

;; Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome! Send them to
;; <skangas@skangas.se> or report them on GitHub.

;; Memoization takes up memory, which should be freed at some point.
;; Because of this, all memoization has a timeout from when the last
;; access was. The default timeout is set by
;; `memoize-default-timeout'.  It can be overriden by using the
;; `memoize' function, but the `defmemoize' macro will always just use
;; the default timeout.

;; If you wait to byte-compile the function until *after* it is
;; memoized then the function and memoization wrapper both get
;; compiled at once, so there's no special reason to do them
;; separately. But there really isn't much advantage to compiling the
;; memoization wrapper anyway.

;; To (try to) visit a package's homepage, just

;;
;; The list of kludges used to guess the package's homepage is stored

;; own functions.
;;
;; These functions are applied to a melpa recipe and return a string
;; containing the URL of the package - note that here applied refers
;; to `apply'.  See `muv::github-kludge' for an example.
;;
;; The kludges in the list are applied in order until one of them
;; returns non-nil. The first non-nil result is then interpreted
;; as the URL to be visited.
;;
;; Customization
;; -------------
;;
;; If `muv:enable-muv-button' is non nil - the default - a
;; Visit Homepage button will be show in the package description.
;; The button can be disabled by customizing `muv:enable-muv-button',

;;
;; Purpose
;; -------
;; maxframe provides the ability to maximize the emacs frame and stay within
;; the display resolution.
;;
;; Usage
;; -----
;; Example of lines to be added to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'maxframe)
;;     (add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'maximize-frame t)
;;
;; If using two framebuffers (monitors), it might be necesssary to specify a
;; mf-max-width value set to the pixel width of main framebuffer.  This is
;; necessary because emacs does not yet support sniffing different
;; framebuffers.  Example:
;;
;;     (require 'maxframe)
;;     (setq mf-max-width 1600)  ;; Pixel width of main monitor.
;;     (add-hook 'window-setup-hook 'maximize-frame t)
;;
;; To restore the frame to it's original dimensions, call restore-frame:
;;
;;     M-x restore-frame
;;
;; How it works
;; ------------
;; puts the emacs frame in the top left corner of the display and calculates
;; the maximum number of columns and rows that can fit in the display
;;
;; Limitations
;; -----------
;; Requires Emacs 22 (for fringe support), but maximize-frame still works
;; under Emacs 21 on Windows.
;;
;; Credits
;; -------
;; The w32 specific functions were borrowed from the Emacs Manual:
;; http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/windows/big.html#windows-like-window-ops

;; This plug-in provides support for an additional default remote
;; which when pushing is used instead of the \"merge\" default specified
;; by the git-config(1) option `branch.<name>.remote'.

;; Together `branch.<name>.remote' and `branch.<name>.merge' set the
;; default used by git-pull(1) and git-push(1).  Like their git
;; counterparts `magit-push' and `magit-pull' use these options. So
;; does `magit-status' which displays commits not pushed to or not
;; pulled from the default remote/branch.

;; This works nicely if commits most often flow like this:
;;
;;   +------------+            +------------+
;;   |   remote   | -- pull -> |   local    |
;;   |    repo    | <- push -- |    repo    |
;;   +------------+            +------------+

;; But it is inconventient if commits most often flow through your
;; local repository like this:
;;
;;   +------------+            +------------+            +------------+

;; This package modifies Magit to automatically detect whether the
;; latter workflow is used; and if so provide additional information
;; related to that \"personal\" or \"push\" remote and push to it by
;; default.

;; When `magit-push-remote-mode' is turned on and the repository has a
;; push-remote `magit-push' and `magit-push-tags' now by default push
;; to the push-remote, and `magit-status' shows information related to
;; both the push and pull (Git's default) remote.

;; This is done by REDEFINING `magit-push-tags' and adding specialized
;; functions to the hooks `magit-status-sections-hook' and
;; `magit-push-hook'.

;; To enable this turn on the global `magit-push-remote-mode' and

;;
;; 1 Overview
;; ==========
;;
;;   This is a minor mode for interactively stepping through the expansion
;;   of macros in Emacs Lisp source code. It lets you see exactly what
;;   happens at each step of the expansion process by pretty-printing the
;;   expanded forms inline in the source buffer, which is read-only while
;;   macro expansions are visible. You can expand and collapse macro forms
;;   one step at a time, and evaluate or instrument them for debugging with
;;   Edebug as normal (but see \"Bugs and known limitations\", below).
;;   Single-stepping through the expansion is useful for debugging macros
;;   that expand into another macro form, especially one like `lexical-let'
;;   that does significant rewriting. These can be difficult to debug with
;;   Emacs' built-in `macroexpand', because `macroexpand' continues
;;   expansion until the top-level form is no longer a macro call.
;;
;;   The mode also adds some simple additional fontification to
;;   macro-expanded code. The heads of macro sub-forms are fontified using
;;   `macrostep-macro-face'. Uninterned symbols (gensyms) are fontified
;;   based on which step in the expansion created them, to distinguish them
;;   from normal symbols and from other gensyms with the same print name.
;;   Use `customize-group' with the `macrostep' group to customize these
;;   faces.
;;
;;
;; 2 Key-bindings and usage
;; ========================
;;
;;   The standard macrostep-mode keybindings are the following:
;;
;;   e, =, RET : expand the macro form following point one step
;;   c, u, DEL : collapse the form following point
;;   q, C-c C-c: collapse all expanded forms and exit macrostep-mode
;;   n, TAB    : jump to the next macro form in the expansion
;;   p, M-TAB  : jump to the previous macro form in the expansion
;;
;;   It's not very useful to enable and disable macrostep-mode directly.
;;   Instead, bind `macrostep-expand' to a key in `emacs-lisp-mode-map',
;;   for example C-c e:
;;
;;   ,----
;;   | (define-key emacs-lisp-mode-map (kbd \"C-c e\") 'macrostep-expand)
;;   `----
;;
;;   You can then enter macrostep-mode and expand a macro form completely
;;   by typing `C-c e e e ...' as many times as necessary.
;;
;;   Exit macrostep-mode either with `q', `C-c C-c', or by successively
;;   typing `c' to collapse all expanded forms back to their original text.
;;
;;
;; 3 Expanding sub-forms
;; =====================
;;
;;   By moving point around in the macro expansion (perhaps using the `n'
;;   and `p' keys), you can macro-expand sub-forms before fully expanding
;;   the enclosing form. This can be useful in some cases, but you should
;;   keep in mind that it does not correspond to the way Emacs actually
;;   expands macro calls when evaluating or compiling your code. Macro
;;   expansion in Emacs Lisp always proceeds by fully expanding the outer
;;   form to a non-macro form before doing anything with the sub-forms.
;;
;;   For example, with `cl' loaded, try expanding the following form:
;;
;;   ,----
;;   | (dolist (l list-of-lists)
;;   |  (incf (car l)))
;;   `----
;;
;;   to produce the following:
;;
;;   ,----
;;   | (block nil
;;   |   (let
;;   |       ((--cl-dolist-temp-- list-of-lists)
;;   |        l)
;;   |     (while --cl-dolist-temp--
;;   |       (setq l
;;   |             (car --cl-dolist-temp--))
;;   |       (incf
;;   |        (car l))
;;   |       (setq --cl-dolist-temp--
;;   |             (cdr --cl-dolist-temp--)))
;;   |     nil))
;;   `----
;;
;;   where the forms beginning `block' and `incf' are both macro calls.
;;
;;   At this point, you can either continue expanding the `block' form,
;;   which corresponds to the real order of macro expansion in evaluation,
;;   or type `n' to move point to the unexpanded `incf' and expand it to a
;;   `callf' form and finally to a `let*' form. If you then move point back
;;   to the `block' and expand it, an unexpanded `incf' form appears again
;;   in the result. This might look visually confusing, but it does at
;;   least correspond to the way real macro expansion works.
;;
;;   Why allow expanding sub-forms out of order like this at all? The main
;;   reason is for debugging macros which expand into another macro, like
;;   `lexical-let', that programmatically expands its contents in order to
;;   rewrite them. In this case, expanding the sub-forms first allows you
;;   to see what `lexical-let' would compute via `cl-macroexpand-all'.
;;
;;
;; 4 Bugs and known limitations
;; ============================
;;
;;   You can evaluate and edebug macro-expanded forms and step through the
;;   macro-expanded version, but the form that `eval-defun' and friends
;;   read from the buffer won't have the uninterned symbols of the real
;;   macro expansion. This will probably work OK with CL-style gensyms, but
;;   may cause problems with `make-symbol' symbols if they have the same
;;   print name as another symbol in the expansion. It's possible that
;;   using `print-circle' and `print-gensym' could get around this.
;;
;;   The macro stepper doesn't bother trying to determine whether or not a
;;   sub-form is in an evaluated position before highlighting it as a
;;   macro. It does exclude `lambda' from treatment as a macro, since that
;;   leads to an endless series of expansions: `(function (function ...
;;   ))'. It would be better to recognise `function', `quote' and other
;;   special forms using their `edebug-form-spec' property.
;;
;;   Please send other bug reports and feature requests to the author.

;; Lua-mode supports c-mode style formatting and sending of

;; Lua-mode works with Hide Show minor mode (see ``hs-minor-mode``).

;; Key-bindings

;; To see all the keybindings for Lua mode, look at `lua-setup-keymap'
;; or start `lua-mode' and type `\\C-h m'.
;; The keybindings may seem strange, since I prefer to use them with
;; lua-prefix-key set to nil, but since those keybindings are already used
;; the default for `lua-prefix-key' is `\\C-c', which is the conventional

;; You can customise the keybindings either by setting `lua-prefix-key'
;; or by putting the following in your .emacs
;;      (define-key lua-mode-map <your-key> <function>)
;; for all the functions you need.

;;
;; To show the source code for a Java identifier found in the log file, place

;;
;; This command is only enabled if package jtags is loaded. Note that this
;; version of Log4j mode requires jtags version 0.95 or later. For more
;; information about jtags, see http://jtags.sourceforge.net.
;;
;; Finally, the commands `M-}' and `M-{' are redefined to move to the end
;; and beginning of the current log record.
;;
;; The latest version of Log4j mode can always be found at
;; http://log4j-mode.sourceforge.net.

;; Installation:

;; Place \"log4j-mode.el\" in your `load-path' and place the following lines
;; of code in your init file:
;;
;; (autoload 'log4j-mode \"log4j-mode\" \"Major mode for viewing log files.\" t)
;; (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.log\\\\'\" . log4j-mode))
;;
;; To enable source code browsing, place \"jtags.el\" in your `load-path' too.

;; Configuration:

;; You can customize the faces that are used for syntax highlighting.
;; Type `M-x customize-group' and enter group name \"log4j-mode\".
;;
;; Log file buffers are auto reverted by default. If you don't like that,
;; set `log4j-auto-revert-flag' to nil.
;;
;; You can also customize the regular expressions that are used to find the
;; beginning and end of multi-line log records. However, in many cases this
;; will not be necessary. Log4j mode can automatically detect single-line and
;; multi-line log records created by Log4j and JDK's built-in logging package.
;;
;; If you use the arrow keys to move around in the text, you can define `C-up'
;; and `C-down' to move to the end and beginning of the current log record.
;; Put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (add-hook
;;  'log4j-mode-hook
;;  (lambda ()
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control down)] 'log4j-forward-record)
;;    (define-key log4j-mode-local-map [(control up)] 'log4j-backward-record)))

;; XEmacs:

;; XEmacs tends to move the point to `point-min' when auto reverting a buffer.
;; Setting the customizable variable `log4j-restore-point-flag' to 't leaves
;; the point at its original position.
;;
;; To tell XEmacs which tags table files to use for log files, modify variable
;; `tag-table-alist' to include log files. Using the example in file \"jtags.el\"
;; you could put the following lines of code in your init file:
;;
;; (setq tag-table-alist '((\"\\\\.\\\\(java\\\\|log\\\\)$\" . \"c:/java/j2sdk1.4.2/src\")
;;                         (\"\\\\.\\\\(java\\\\|log\\\\)$\" . \"c:/projects/tetris/src\")))

;; Here we provide functions which facilitate writing multi-file Emacs

;; https://github.com/rocky/emacs-load-relative/wiki/NYC-Lisp-talk for
;; the the rationale behind this.
;;
;; The functions we add are relative versions of `load', and `require'
;; and versions which take list arguments. We also add a `__FILE__'
;; function and a `provide-me' macro.

;; The latest version of this code is at:
;;     http://github.com/rocky/emacs-load-relative/

;; `__FILE__' returns the file name that that the calling program is
;; running.  If you are `eval''ing a buffer then the file name of that
;; buffer is used. The name was selected to be analogous to the name
;; used in C, Perl, Python, and Ruby.

;; `load-relative' loads an Emacs Lisp file relative to another
;; (presumably currently running) Emacs Lisp file. For example suppose
;; you have Emacs Lisp files \"foo.el\" and \"bar.el\" in the same
;; directory. To load \"bar.el\" from inside Emacs lisp file \"foo.el\":
;;
;;     (require 'load-relative)
;;     (load-relative \"baz\")
;;
;; The above `load-relative' line could above have also been written as:
;;
;;     (load-relative \"./baz\")
;; or:
;;     (load-relative \"baz.el\")  # if you want to exclude any byte-compiled files
;;
;; Use `require-relative' if you want to `require' the file instead of
;; `load'ing it:
;;
;;    (require-relative \"baz\")
;;
;; or:
;;
;;    (require-relative \"./baz\")
;;
;; The above not only does a `require' on 'baz', but makes sure you
;; get that from the same file as you would have if you had issued
;; `load_relative'.
;;
;; Use `require-relative-list' when you have a list of files you want
;; to `require'. To `require-relative' them all in one shot:
;;
;;     (require-relative-list '(\"dbgr-init\" \"dbgr-fringe\"))
;;
;; Finally, macro `provide-me' saves you the trouble of adding a
;; symbol after `provide' using the file basename (without directory
;; or file extension) as the name of the thing you want to
;; provide.
;;
;; Using this constrains the `provide' name to be the same as
;; the filename, but I consider that a good thing.

;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; List-utils is a collection of functions for list manipulation.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; Notable functionality includes
;;
;;     * `list-utils-flatten', a robust list-flattener which handles
;;       cyclic lists, non-nil-terminated lists, and preserves nils
;;       when they are found as list elements.
;;
;;     * `tconc', a simple data structure for efficiently appending
;;       to a list
;;
;; The following functions are provided:
;;
;;     `make-tconc'
;;     `tconc-p'
;;     `tconc-list'
;;     `tconc'
;;     `list-utils-cons-cell-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-length'
;;     `list-utils-improper-p'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-proper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-improper-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-linear-p'
;;     `list-utils-linear-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-p'
;;     `list-utils-cyclic-subseq'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-copy'
;;     `list-utils-make-linear-inplace'
;;     `list-utils-safe-length'
;;     `list-utils-safe-equal'
;;     `list-utils-depth'
;;     `list-utils-flat-length'
;;     `list-utils-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-alist-or-flat-length'
;;     `list-utils-alist-flatten'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after'
;;     `list-utils-insert-before-pos'
;;     `list-utils-insert-after-pos'
;;     `list-utils-and'
;;     `list-utils-not'
;;     `list-utils-xor'
;;     `list-utils-uniq'
;;     `list-utils-dupes'
;;     `list-utils-singlets'
;;     `list-utils-partition-dupes'
;;     `list-utils-plist-reverse'
;;     `list-utils-plist-del'
;;
;; To use list-utils, place the list-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'list-utils)
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library includes an implementation of the classic Lisp
;;     `tconc' which is outside the \"list-utils-\" namespace.

;;
;; Due to the structure of Lisp syntax it's very rare for the
;; programmer to want to insert characters right before \"(\" or right
;; after \")\".  Thus unprefixed printable characters can be used to call
;; commands when the point is at one of these locations, which are
;; further referred to as special.
;;
;; Conveniently, when located at special position it's very clear to
;; which sexp the list-manipulating command will be applied to, what
;; the result be and where the point should end up afterwards.  You
;; can enhance this effect with `show-paren-mode' or similar.
;;
;; Here's an illustration to this effect, with `lispy-clone' (\"*\"
;; represents the point):
;; |--------------------+-----+--------------------|
;; | before             | key | after              |
;; |--------------------+-----+--------------------|
;; |  (looking-at \"(\")* |  c  |  (looking-at \"(\")  |
;; |                    |     |  (looking-at \"(\")* |
;; |--------------------+-----+--------------------|
;; | *(looking-at \"(\")  |  c  | *(looking-at \"(\")  |
;; |                    |     |  (looking-at \"(\")  |
;; |--------------------+-----+--------------------|
;;
;; When special, the digit keys call `digit-argument' which is very
;; convenient since most Lispy commands accept a numeric argument.
;; For instance, \"3c\" is equivalent to \"ccc\" (clone sexp 3 times), and
;; \"4j\" is equivalent to \"jjjj\" (move point 4 sexps down).  Some
;; useful applications are \"9l\" and \"9a\" - they exit list forwards and
;; backwards respectively at most 9 times which makes them effectively
;; equivalent to `end-of-defun' and `beginning-of-defun'.
;;
;; To move the point into a special position, use:
;; \"]\" - calls `lispy-forward'
;; \"[\" - calls `lispy-backward'
;; \"C-3\" - calls `lispy-out-forward' (exit current list forwards)
;; \")\" - calls `lispy-out-forward-nostring' (exit current list
;;       forwards, but self-insert in strings and comments)
;;
;; These are the few Lispy commands that don't care whether the point
;; is special or not.  Other such bindings are `DEL', `C-d', `C-k'.
;;
;; To get out of the special position, you can use any of the good-old
;; navigational commands such as `C-f' or `C-n'.
;; Additionally `SPC' will break out of special to get around the
;; situation when you have the point between open parens like this
;; \"(|(\" and want to start inserting.  `SPC' will change the code to
;; this: \"(| (\".
;;
;; A lot of Lispy commands come in pairs: one reverses the other.
;; Some examples are:
;; |-----+--------------------------+------------+-------------------|
;; | key | command                  | key        | command           |

;; Emacs 24 introduced lexical scope for variables to Emacs
;; Lisp.  However, rather than provide it via a new form, say llet or
;; whatever, the buffer local variable `lexical-binding' was
;; introduced to switch the behaviour of binding forms.  This is an
;; unfortunate situation because the semantics of a piece of code
;; depend on the value of a buffer local variable at the time of
;; evaluation.

;; This minor mode is intended to make it plain what the value of
;; `lexical-binding' is in the buffers used to evaluate Lisp forms.
;; It does this by adding to the mode line the string \"(LEX)\" to
;; indicate lexical binding is enabled, and \"(DYN)\" to indicate that
;; lexical binding is disabled and that dynamic binding is in effect.

;; Other lexical scope specific utilities such as lexbind-lexscratch

;; the time they are saved: use `less-css-compile-at-save' to enable
;; this.
;;
;; Command line utility \"lessc\" is required if setting

;;
;; Also make sure the \"lessc\" executable is in emacs' PATH, example:
;; (setq exec-path (cons (expand-file-name \"~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin\") exec-path))

;; We target lessc >= 1.4.0, and thus use the `--no-color' flag by
;; default.  You may want to adjust `less-css-lessc-options' for
;; compatibility with older versions.
;;
;; `less-css-mode' is derived from `css-mode', and indentation of
;; nested blocks may not work correctly with versions of `css-mode'
;; other than that bundled with recent Emacs.
;;
;; You can specify per-file values for `less-css-compile-at-save',
;; `less-css-output-file-name' or `less-css-output-directory' using a
;; variables header at the top of your .less file, e.g.:
;;
;; // -*- less-css-compile-at-save: t; less-css-output-directory: \"../css\" -*-
;;
;; In the case of files which are included in other .less files, you
;; may want to trigger the compilation of a \"master\" .less file on
;; save: you can accomplish this with `less-css-input-file-name',
;; which is probably best set using directory local variables.

;; The additions of this package fall into the following three
;; categories:
;; 
;; ## 1-Key Compilation ##
;; 
;; Tired of hitting `C-c C-c' 4 times (latex, bibtex, latex, view) for
;; the document to compile? This defines a much needed command that does
;; **everything** at once, and even handles compilation errors!
;; 
;; - C-c C-a **=>** `latex/compile-commands-until-done'
;; 
;; ## Navigation ##
;; 
;; Five new keybindings are defined for navigating between
;; sections/chapters. These are meant to be intuitive to people familiar
;; with `org-mode'.
;; 
;; - C-c C-n **=>** `latex/next-section'  
;; Goes forward to the next section-like command in the buffer (\\part,
;; \\chapter, \\(sub)section, or \\(sub)paragraph, whichever comes first).
;; - C-c C-u **=>** `latex/up-section'  
;; Goes backward to the previous section-like command containing this
;; one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it goes up to the
;; section that contains it.
;; - C-c C-f **=>** `latex/next-section-same-level'  
;; Like next-section, except it skips anything that's \"lower-level\" then
;; the current one. For instance, if you're inside a subsection it finds
;; the next subsection (or higher), skipping any subsubsections or
;; paragraphs.
;; - C-M-f **=>** `latex/forward-environment'
;; Skip over the next environment, or exit the current one, whichever
;; comes first. 
;; - C-M-e **=>** `latex/end-of-environment'
;; Exit the current environment, and skip over some whitespace
;; afterwards. (Like `LaTeX-find-matching-end', but a little more useful.)
;; - C-M-b **=>** `latex/backward-environment'
;; - C-M-a **=>** `latex/beginning-of-environment'
;; - C-c C-p **=>** `latex/previous-section'  
;; - C-c C-b **=>** `latex/previous-section-same-level'  
;; Same as above, but go backward.
;; 
;; ## Whitespace Handling ##
;; 
;; `latex-extra.el' improves `auto-fill-mode' so that it only applies to
;; text, not equations. To use this improvement, just activate
;; `auto-fill-mode' as usual.
;; 
;; It also defines a new command:  
;; 
;; - C-c C-q **=>** `latex/clean-fill-indent-environment'  
;; Completely cleans up the entire current environment. This involves:
;; 
;; 1. Removing extraneous spaces and blank lines.
;; 2. Filling text (and only text, not equations).

;;
;;  Library La Carte lets you execute menu items as commands, with
;;  completion.  You can use it as an alternative to standard library
;;  `tmm.el'.
;;
;;  Type a menu item.  Completion is available.  Completion candidates
;;  are of the form menu > submenu > subsubmenu > ... > menu item.
;;  For example:
;;
;;    File > Open Recent > Cleanup list
;;    File > Open Recent > Edit list...
;;
;;  When you choose a menu-item candidate, the corresponding command
;;  is executed.
;;
;;  Put this in your init file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'lacarte)
;;
;;  Suggested key bindings:
;;
;;    (global-set-key [?\\e ?\\M-x] 'lacarte-execute-command)
;;    (global-set-key [?\\M-`]     'lacarte-execute-menu-command)
;;    (global-set-key [f10]       'lacarte-execute-menu-command)
;;
;;  (The latter two replace standard bindings for `tmm-menubar'.  On
;;  MS Windows, `f10' is normally bound to `menu-bar-open', which uses
;;  the Windows native keyboard access to menus.)
;;
;;  To really take advantage of La Carte, use it together with
;;  Icicles.  Icicles is not required to be able to use La Carte, but
;;  it enhances the functionality of `lacarte.el' considerably.
;;  (Note: `lacarte.el' was originally called `icicles-menu.el'.)
;;
;;  If you use MS Windows keyboard accelerators, consider using
;;  `lacarte-remove-w32-keybd-accelerators' as the value of
;;  `lacarte-convert-menu-item-function'.  It removes any unescaped

;;    (global-set-key [?\\e ?\\M-x] 'lacarte-execute-command)
;;
;;  Type `ESC M-x' (or `ESC ESC x', which is the same thing).  You are

;;
;;  ESC M-x
;;  Command:
;;  Command: t [TAB]
;;  Command: Tools >
;;  Command: Tools > Compa [TAB]
;;  Command: Tools > Compare (Ediff) > Two F [TAB]
;;  Command: Tools > Compare (Ediff) > Two Files... [RET]
;;
;;
;;  Not Just for Wimps and Noobs Anymore
;;  ------------------------------------
;;
;;  *You* don't use menus.  Nah, they're too slow!  Only newbies and
;;  wimps use menus.  Well not any more.  Use the keyboard to access
;;  any menu item, without knowing where it is or what its full name
;;  is.  Type just part of its name and use completion to get the
;;  rest: the complete path and item name.
;;
;;
;;  Commands and Menu Commands
;;  --------------------------
;;
;;  You can bind either `lacarte-execute-menu-command' or
;;  `lacarte-execute-command' to a key such as `ESC M-x'.
;;
;;  `lacarte-execute-menu-command' uses only menu commands.
;;  `lacarte-execute-command' lets you choose among ordinary Emacs
;;  commands, in addition to menu commands.  You can use a prefix arg
;;  with `lacarte-execute-command' to get the same effect as
;;  `lacarte-execute-menu-command'.
;;
;;  Use `lacarte-execute-command' if you don't care whether a command
;;  is on a menu.  Then, if you want a command that affects a buffer,
;;  just type `buf'.  This is especially useful if you use Icicles -
;;  see below.
;;
;;  You can use a prefix arg with `lacarte-execute-menu-command' to
;;  have it offer only items from specific keymaps: the local (major
;;  mode) keymap, the global keymap, or the minor-mode keymaps.
;;
;;  By default, in Icicle mode, `ESC M-x' is bound to
;;  `lacarte-execute-command', and `M-`' is bound to
;;  `lacarte-execute-menu-command'.
;;
;;
;;  Icicles Enhances Dining A La Carte
;;  ----------------------------------
;;
;;  Use Icicles with La Carte to get more power and convenience.
;;
;;  It is Icicles that lets you choose menu items a la carte, in fact.
;;  That is, you can access them directly, wherever they might be in
;;  the menu hierachy.  Without Icicles, you are limited to choosing
;;  items by their menu-hierarchy prefixes, and you must complete the
;;  entire menu prefix to the item, from the top of the menu on down.
;;  With Icicles, you can directly match any parts of a menu item and
;;  its hierarchy path.  Icicles is here:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.
;;
;;  Type any part of a menu-item, then use the Page Up and Page Down
;;  keys (`prior' and `next') to cycle through all menu commands that
;;  contain the text you typed somewhere in their name.  You can match
;;  within any menu or within all menus; that is, you can match any
;;  part(s) of the menu-hierachy prefix.
;;
;;  You can use `S-TAB' to show and choose from all such \"apropos
;;  completions\", just as you normally use `TAB' to show all prefix
;;  completions (that is, ordinary completions).  Vanilla, prefix
;;  completion is still available using `TAB', and you can cycle
;;  through the prefix completions using the arrow keys.
;;
;;  You can use Icicles \"progressive completion\" to match multiple
;;  parts of a menu item separately, in any order.  For example, if
;;  you want a menu command that has to do with buffers and
;;  highlighting, type `buf M-SPC hig S-TAB'.
;;
;;  Icicles apropos completion also lets you type a regular expression
;;  (regexp) - it is matched against all of the possible menu items.
;;  So, for instance, you could type `^e.+buff [next] [next]...' to
;;  quickly cycle to menu command `Edit > Go To > Goto End of Buffer'.
;;  Or type `.*print.*buf S-TAB' to choose from the list of all menu
;;  commands that match `print' followed somewhere by `buf'.
;;
;;  If you know how to use regexps, you can easily and quickly get to
;;  a menu command you want, or at least narrow the list of candidates
;;  for completion and cycling.
;;
;;  Additional benefits of using Icicles with La Carte:
;;
;;  * When you cycle to a candidate menu item, or you complete to one
;;    (entirely), the Emacs command associated with the menu item is
;;    shown in the mode line of buffer `*Completions*'.
;;
;;  * You can use `M-h' to complete your minibuffer input against
;;    commands, including menu-item commands, that you have entered
;;    previously.  You can also use the standard history keys
;;    (e.g. `M-p', `M-r') to access these commands.
;;
;;
;;  Menu Organization Helps You Find a Command
;;  ------------------------------------------
;;
;;  Unlike commands listed in a flat `*Apropos*' page, menu items are
;;  organized, grouped logically by common area of application
;;  (`File', `Edit',...).  This grouping is also available when
;;  cycling completion candidates using Icicles, and you can take
;;  advantage of it to hasten your search for the right command.
;;
;;  You want to execute a command that puts the cursor at the end of a
;;  buffer, but you don't remember its name, what menu it might be a
;;  part of, or where it might appear in that (possibly complex) menu.
;;  With Icicles and La Carte, you type `ESC M-x' and then type
;;  `buffer' at the prompt.  You use the Page Up and Page Down keys to
;;  cycle through all menu items that contain the word `buffer'.
;;
;;  There are lots of such menu items.  But all items from the same
;;  menu (e.g. `File') are grouped together.  You cycle quickly (not
;;  reading) to the `Edit' menu, because you guess that moving the
;;  cursor has more to do with editing than with file operations, tool

;;
;; This library changes keyboard macro query points into decision points or conditional
;; branches. A query point can be created by typing C-x q or entering the `kbd-macro-query'
;; command when entering a keyboard macro.
;; When the macro is replayed and the query point is reached the user will be prompted with
;; options to either quit the macro, continue the rest of the macro, enter recursive edit and
;; store a new macro, add a conditional branch (explained next), or replay a previously saved
;; (named) macro. The user may also recenter the window by pressing C-l.
;; If the user chooses to add a conditional branch they will be prompted for a condition form,
;; and an action to perform if that condition evaluates to non-nil. The action can be to quit the macro,
;; continue the macro, create a new macro for that condition, execute an elisp form or command, or replay
;; a previously saved macro.
;; If the condition evaluates to non-nil the next time the macro is replayed then the corresponding
;; action will be performed. If several conditions-action pairs are created for a given query point
;; then the conditions will be evaluated in the order in which they where created until one of them evaluates
;; to non-nil. If they all evaluate to nil then the user will be prompted as before to either quit, continue,
;; create/replay a macro, or add another condition-action pair.

;; By adding query points to the end of each newly created macro, macro decision trees can be built up
;; and complex automated operations performed.

;; NOTES: 
;;
;; If you are creating a complex macro with several layers of conditional branching you should build it up
;; layer at a time from the bottom up, naming the constituent macros as you go. You need to make sure all
;; conditions of a constituent macro are defined before using that macro in another one as you will not be
;; able to edit the constituent macro while running the parent macro. It may be safer to just write a program
;; to do the task instead.
;; If you want to see what macros have been named (and maybe run one) you can use `kbd-macro-query' (C-x C-k q).
;; Also note that when prompted for a condition you can scroll forward through the input history using M-n to get
;; conditions for searching for strings/regexps. You can add to this list by customizing `kmacro-decision-conditions'.

;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;
;;  `kmacro-decision-conditions'
;;    A list of conditions to be made available in the history list in calls to `kmacro-decision'

;;; The macro keydef provides a simplified interface to define-key that
;;; smoothly handles a number of common complications.

;;; The global-set-key command isn't ideal for novices because of its
;;; relatively complex syntax. And I always found it a little
;;; inconvenient to have to quote the name of the command---that is, I
;;; tend to forget the quote every once in a while and then have to go
;;; back and fix it after getting a load error.

;;; One of the best features is that you can give an Emacs lisp form (or
;;; even a series of forms) as the key definition argument, instead of a
;;; command name, and the keydef macro will automatically add an
;;; interactive lambda wrapper. I use this to get, for example, a more
;;; emphatic kill-buffer command (no confirmation query) by writing
;;;
;;;   (keydef \"<S-f11>\" (kill-buffer nil))
;;;
;;; For keydef the key sequence is expected to be given uniformly in the
;;; form of a string for the 'kbd' macro, with one or two refinements
;;; that are intended to conceal from users certain points of confusion,
;;; such as (for those whose keyboards lack a Meta key) the whole
;;; Meta/ESC/escape muddle.

;;; I have had some trouble in the past regarding the distinction
;;; between ESC and [escape] (in a certain combination of circumstances
;;; using the latter form caused definitions made with the other form to
;;; be masked---most puzzling when I wasn't expecting it). Therefore the
;;; ESC form is actually preprocessed a bit to ensure that the binding
;;; goes into esc-map.

;;; There is one other special feature of the key sequence syntax
;;; expected by the keydef macro: You can designate a key definition for
;;; a particular mode-map by giving the name of the mode together with
;;; the key sequence string in list form, for example
;;;
;;;   (keydef (latex \"C-c %\") comment-region)
;;;
;;; This means that the key will be defined in latex-mode-map. [The
;;; point of using this particular example will be made clear below.] I
;;; arranged for the mode name to be given in symbol form just because I
;;; didn't want to have to type extra quotes if I could get away with
;;; it. For the same reason this kind of first arg is not written in
;;; dotted pair form.

;;; If the given mode-map is not defined, keydef \"does the right thing\"
;;; using eval-after-load. In order to determine what library the
;;; mode-map will be loaded from, it uses the following algorithm:
;;;
;;; First check if foo-mode has autoload information. If not, check
;;; whether \"foo-mode\" is the name of a library that can be found
;;; somewhere in the load-path (using locate-library); otherwise check
;;; whether \"foo\" is the name of a locatable library. Failing that, give
;;; up and return nil.
;;;
;;; There is a fall-back mechanism, however, to handle exceptional
;;; cases. If foo-mode-map is undefined but the list mode-map-alist
;;; contains an entry of the form (foo-mode-map foo-other-name-map),
;;; then foo-other-name-map is used as the name of the
;;; keymap.
;;;
;;; If the mode-map is not loaded yet AND the command being bound to a
;;; key is undefined at the time of the keydef assignment, it presents
;;; further problems. The simplest solution is to assume that after the
;;; package is loaded that defines the mode-map, the given command will
;;; be defined and satisfy commandp. With some extra effort it should be
;;; possible to determine more accurately whether the command will be
;;; defined or not, but I'm not sure I want to go to that extreme, since
;;; as far as I can see it would require opening the package file and
;;; searching through it for a matching defun/defalias/fset statement.
;;;
;;; If the mode name matches the mode map name, but foo-mode is not
;;; autoloaded, then some autoload information may need to be provided.
;;; For example, the following line allows definitions to be made for
;;; debugger-mode-map even before debug.el is loaded.
;;;
;;;  (autoload 'debugger-mode \"debug\" \"Autoloaded.\" 'interactive)
;;;
;;; Although there is no easy way provided by keydef for
;;; gnus-summary-limit-map to be accessed directly, because
;;; its name does not include \"mode\", you can get a binding into
;;; such a map by writing
;;;
;;;   (keydef (gnus-summary \"/ z\") gnus-summary-limit-to-zapped)
;;;
;;; which binds /z in gnus-summary-mode-map, which is equivalent to
;;; binding z in gnus-summary-limit-map.
;;;
;;; You might need to add an autoload statement for gnus-summary-mode
;;; in order for this to work, so that keydef knows that it should use
;;; eval-after-load and that the file the mode function will be loaded
;;; from is called \"gnus-sum\" rather than \"gnus-summary-mode\". (If it
;;; were the latter, keydef would be able to resolve everything
;;; automatically.)

;;; We COULD HAVE just put the definitions into the mode hook in the
;;; standard way, instead of using eval-after-load, but that would mean
;;; the key definitions get executed repetitiously every time the mode
;;; function gets called, which seems better to avoid, if only for
;;; esthetic reasons (if it can be done without too much trouble).

;;; The following examples show some typical keydef lines followed by the
;;; results of the macro expansion.

;;; Simplest kind of definition:
;;;
;;; (keydef \"C-x m\" gnus-group-mail)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd \"C-x m\") (quote gnus-group-mail))

;;; What if the command name is misspelled?
;;;
;;; (keydef \"C-x m\" gnus-gruop-mail)
;;;
;;;   -->(message \"keydef: gnus-gruop-mail unknown \\
;;;                \\(perhaps misspelled, or not loaded yet\\)\")

;;; A leading ESC gets special handling to go through esc-map.
;;;
;;; (keydef \"ESC &\" query-replace-regexp)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd \"&\") (quote query-replace-regexp))

;;; Undefine a key:
;;;
;;; (keydef \"ESC `\")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd \"`\") nil)

;;; If the second arg is a string, keydef defines the given key sequence
;;; as a keyboard macro. The following macro puts in TeX-style double
;;; quotes and then moves the cursor backward to leave it in the middle:
;;;
;;; (keydef \"\\\"\" \"``''\\C-b\\C-b\")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd \"\\\"\") \"``''\\002\\002\")

;;; Reset a key to self-insert
;;;
;;; (keydef \"\\\"\" \"\\\"\")
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map (kbd \"\\\"\") (quote self-insert-command))

;;; If the second arg is a list, wrap it in an interactive lambda form.
;;;
;;; (keydef \"C-z\"
;;;   (message \"Control-Z key disabled---redefine it if desired.\"))
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map
;;;       (kbd \"C-z\")
;;;       (lambda (arg)
;;;         \"anonymous keydef function\"
;;;         (interactive \"p\")
;;;         (message \"Control-Z key disabled---redefine it if desired.\")))
;;;
;;; Note that the interactive lambda wrapper added by keydef, when the
;;; CMD does not satisfy commandp, always takes a single prefix argument
;;; named \"arg\", which is read in the usual way with (interactive \"p\");
;;; so this could be used in the body of the function if need be.

;;; This shows the notation for F-keys.
;;;
;;; (keydef \"<C-f17>\" (kill-buffer nil))
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key global-map
;;;       (kbd \"<C-f17>\")

;;;         \"*Anonymous function created by keydef.\"
;;;         (interactive \"p\")
;;;         (kill-buffer nil)))

;;; Because of the confusing Meta/Escape complications, I recommend to
;;; the users that I support that they use the ESC notation
;;; consistently if that is what they type from their keyboard, even
;;; for F-key definitions that might normally be written with <M-...>

;;;
;;; (keydef \"ESC <f3>\" find-file-read-only)
;;;
;;;   -->(define-key esc-map (kbd \"<f3>\") (quote find-file-read-only))

;;
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"hj\"     'undo)
;;      (key-chord-define-global \",.\"     \"<>\\C-b\")

;; ########   Terminology   ########################################
;;
;; In this package, a \"key chord\" is two keys pressed simultaneously,
;; or a single key quickly pressed twice.
;;
;; (Sometimes pressing SHIFT and/or META plus another key is call a chord,
;; but not here. However SHIFT plus two normal keys can be a \"key chord\".)

;; ########   Description   ########################################
;;
;; Key chord mode acts like a global minor mode controlled by the function
;; `key-chord-mode'.
;;
;; Key chord definitions are stored in ordinary key-maps.
;; The function `key-chord-define-global' defines a chord in the global
;; key-map and `key-chord-define' defines a chord in a specified key-map,
;; for example for a specific mode.
;;
;; A TWO-key chord is two distinct keys pressed simultaneously (within
;; one tenth of a second, or so).
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;;      (key-chord-define-global \",.\"     \"<>\\C-b\")
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"hj\"     'undo)
;;      (key-chord-define-global [?h ?j]  'undo)  ; the same
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"jk\"     'dabbrev-expand)
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"cv\"     'reindent-then-newline-and-indent)
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"4r\"     \"$\")
;;
;; Comma and dot pressed together insert a pair of angle brackets.
;; `h' and `j' pressed together invoke the undo command.
;; `j' and `k' pressed together invoke the dabbrev-expand command.
;; 'c' and 'v' pressed together insert a newline.
;; `4' and `r' pressed together insert a dollar sign.
;;
;; A ONE-key chord is a single key quickly pressed twice (within one third
;; of a second or so). 
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"''\"     \"`'\\C-b\")
;;      (key-chord-define-global \",,\"     'indent-for-comment)
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"qq\"     \"the \")
;;      (key-chord-define-global \"QQ\"     \"The \")
;;
;; Tick (') pressed twice inserts a back-tick and a tick (`').
;; Comma (,) pressed twice indents for and/or inserts a comment.
;; `q' pressed twice inserts the word \"the \".
;;
;; Examples: Mode specific chords
;;
;;      (key-chord-define c++-mode-map \";;\"  \"\\C-e;\")
;;      (key-chord-define c++-mode-map \"{}\"  \"{\\n\\n}\\C-p\\t\")
;;
;; The command `key-chord-describe' lists currently defined key chords.
;; The standard command `describe-bindings' (C-h b) will also show key chords.
;;
;; The standard command `describe-key' (C-h k) will accept a key chord and
;; show its definition. (Isn't that amazing. There is no explicit code to
;; carry out this functionality.)

;; ########   Tips   ########################################
;;
;; Don't chord key combinations that exists in the languages you typically
;; write. Otherwise, if you are typing fast, two key intended to be separate
;; letters might instead trig a chord.
;; E.g. \"uu\" would be a good chord in spanish but not in finnish, and
;; \"hj\" would be a good chord in english but not in swedish. 
;;
;; Don't rely solely on /usr/dict/words to find unusual combination.
;; For example \"cv\" or \"fg\" can be quite common in certain kinds of
;; programming. Grep your own texts to verify that a combination is unusual.
;; And don't forget to check both permutations: \"fg\" and \"gf\".
;;
;; Choose two keys that are close to each other on the keyboard, so they
;; can be quickly typed without effort. Chords involving two hands (as
;; opposed to two fingers on one hand) are harder to type (quickly).
;; The idea is that key chords are to replace function keys for functions
;; that are frequently performed while the hands are in writing position.
;;
;; Key chords might not work well over a slow network.

;; ########   Limitations   ########################################
;;
;; When recording keyboard macros, the time between keyboard inputs are not
;; recorded. Thus, the key-chord-input-method cannot know for sure if two keys
;; in a macro was a chord or not. The current solution remembers the first key
;; of the chords typed during macro recording, and keys that match those (and
;; are defined as chords) are considered key-chords during macro execution.
;; This knowledge is not saved with `name-last-kbd-macro', so they may
;; execute wrong if they contain pair of keys that match defined chords.
;;
;; Emacs will not call input-method-function for keys that have non numeric
;; codes or whos code is outside the range 32..126. Thus you cannot define
;; key chords involving function keys, control keys, or even your non-english
;; letters (on national keyboards) that otherwise are well positioned for
;; chording on your keyboard.
;; (I think chording left and right arrow keys would be useful, but cannot do.
;; I consider this a bug in Emacs. Input methods could happily return
;; unmodified *any* key they don't know about.)
;;
;; Key chords longer that 2 keys are not supported. It could be done, but I
;; don't think it is worth the trubbel since most keyboards will not reliably
;; send all key codes when 3 or more keys are pressed simultaneously.
;; It might also be a bit trickier to maintain performance.
;;
;; Key chord mode uses input-method-function. And so do internationalisation
;; packages (mule, quail, etc). Do not expect them to work well together.
;; The last one that gets the input-method-function rules.

;; ########   Implementation   ########################################
;;
;; Key chords piggy back in ordinary key maps, so they can be defined
;; per mode without having to add hooks to all modes.
;;
;; Key chord key codes are vectors beginning with the atom `key-chord'.
;; A two key chord, e.g. \"hj\", will add two entries in the key-map.
;; E.g. [key-chord ?h ?j] and [key-chord ?h ?j].
;;
;; When key-chord-mode is enabled input-method-function is set to
;; key-chord-input-method.

;; ########   To do   ########################################
;;
;; * Find a way to save key-chord info in keyboard macros.
;;
;; * Save previous value of input-method-function? And call it?
;;
;; * input-method-function is reset in *info* buffers! What to do?

;; Usage:
;;
;; * Zero state Kanban: Directly displaying org-mode todo states as kanban board
;;
;; Use the functions kanban-headers and kanban-zero in TBLFM lines to
;; get your org-mode todo states as kanban table. Update with C-c C-c
;; on the TBLFM line.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;; |   |   |   |

;; This library is intended to aid in the construction of functions
;; for navigating projects.  The `defjump' function using a hopefully
;; convenient specification schema which jumps to new file/methods
;; based upon the file/method context of the current buffer/point.

;; This effort was inspired heavily by find-file-in-project.el by Phil
;; Hagelberg and Doug Alcorn, and toggle.el by Ryan Davis.  The
;; initial goal of jump.el was to subsume both of these tools.

;;; Example: (jumping to the related model in a rails application)

;; Provides a function `jumblr-new-game' (aliased to `jumblr') which
;; launches a word game closely based on the old TextTwist by Yahoo.

;; The interface should be pretty intuitive: it displays a sequence of
;; letters, along with a series of blanks.  The blanks represent words
;; which can be made from the letters.  You type a word and \"submit\"
;; it by either hitting SPC or RET; the word replaces one of the
;; blanks if it fits.  Hitting SPC or RET with an empty guess
;; reshuffles the letters.

;; I tried to make the interface pretty responsive; take a look at the
;; screenshots in the github repository for a sense of how it works.

;;; Notes about the implementation:

;; The implementation is pretty straightforward and mostly consists of
;; functions to find permutations and subsets of words; I'm sure this
;; could be made much faster.

;; The most important aspect for game play is actually the word list:
;; in order for the game to be fun it must know all the words you can
;; think of, but not have too many obscure words.  It turns out to be
;; surprisingly difficult to find that balance.  My approach is as
;; follows:
;;
;; 1. Take the SIL english word list and intersect it with the New
;;    Oxford English Dictionary which comes with mac osx.  I then
;;    removed the three letter words which were obviously acronyms,
;;    abbreviations for longer words, or racial slurs.  This is the
;;    \"expert\" word list and contains about 85,000 words.
;;    (source: http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/)
;;
;; 2. Take the \"8\" word list from
;;    http://www.keithv.com/software/wlist/ and intersect it with the
;;    \"expert\" list.  This becomes the \"hard\" list and contains about
;;    47,000 words.
;;
;; 3. Take the \"9\" word list from the above link and intersect with
;;    with the \"expert\" list.  This is the \"medium\" list and contains
;;    about 36,000 words.
;;
;; 4. Take the \"10\" word list from the above link and intersect it
;;    with the \"expert\" list.  This contains 21,000 words and is the
;;    \"easy\" list.
;;
;; Let me know how you find the difficulty levels -- I'd really
;; appreciate the feedback!

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\") t)

;; Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
;; (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/jumblr.el\")
;; (require 'jumblr)

;;; Customization:

;; See the defvar definitions at the beginning of the source code.
;; For example, to switch the dictionary, add the following to your
;; .emacs:
;;
;; (setq jumblr-dict-file \"dict/easy.txt\")

"]) (jtags . [(20111208 1022) nil "enhanced tags functionality for Java development" tar ";;; Commentary:

;; The main purpose of `jtags-mode' is to provide an improved tags lookup
;; function for Java source code, compared to the ordinary etags package.
;; While etags knows only the name of the identifier, jtags also knows the
;; context in which the identifier is used. This allows jtags to find the
;; correct declaration at once, instead of the declaration that happens to
;; appear first in the tags table file. The jtags package also contains a
;; function for completing partly typed class members, and functions for
;; managing tags table files.
;;
;; The following interactive functions are included in jtags mode:
;;
;; - jtags-member-completion:      find all completions of the partly typed
;;                                 method or variable name at point
;; - jtags-show-declaration:       look up and display the declaration of the
;;                                 indentifier at point
;; - jtags-show-documentation:     look up and display the Javadoc for the
;;                                 indentifier at point
;; - jtags-update-tags-files:      update all tags table files with the latest
;;                                 source code changes
;; - jtags-update-this-tags-file:  update the tags table file in which the
;;                                 class in the current buffer is tagged
;;
;; Throughout this file, the two terms DECLARATION and DEFINITION are used
;; repeatedly. The DECLARATION of an identifier is the place in the Java source
;; code where the identifier is declared, e.g. the class declaration. The
;; DEFINITION of an identifier is the data structure used by jtags to describe
;; the declaration, containing file name, line number etc.

;; Installation:

;; Place \"jtags.el\" in your `load-path' and place the following lines in your
;; init file:
;;
;; (autoload 'jtags-mode \"jtags\" \"Toggle jtags mode.\" t)
;; (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'jtags-mode)

;; Configuration:

;; Add the Emacs \"bin\" directory to your path, and restart Emacs to make the
;; etags program available to jtags mode.
;;
;; Unzip the source code files that come with the JDK and other products you
;; use, e.g. JUnit. The etags program can only extract information from source
;; code files, and not from class files.
;;
;; Configure the tags table list in your init file. Include the directories
;; where you unzipped the external source code files, and the directories where
;; your project's source code is located.
;;
;; GNU Emacs example:
;;
;; (setq tags-table-list '(\"c:/java/jdk1.6.0/src\"
;;                         \"c:/projects/tetris/src\"))
;; (setq tags-revert-without-query 't)
;;
;; XEmacs example:
;;
;; (setq tag-table-alist '((\"\\\\.java$\" . \"c:/java/jdk1.6.0/src\")
;;                         (\"\\\\.java$\" . \"c:/projects/tetris/src\")))
;; (setq tags-auto-read-changed-tag-files 't)
;;
;; Type `M-x jtags-update-tags-files' to update all of the files in the tags
;; table list. If you do not have write access to all of the tags table files,
;; e.g. in the JDK installation directory, you can copy the source code tree,
;; or ask the system administrator to create the tags table files for you. If
;; you are running Linux, you can start Emacs using the sudo command once, to
;; create the tags table files.
;;
;; The shell command that runs when you update tags table files is defined in
;; the variable `jtags-etags-command'. Change this variable to run a specific
;; version of etags, or to include other source code files in the tags table
;; files.
;;
;; To display Javadoc for third party libraries, you need to customize the
;; `jtags-javadoc-root-alist' and add Javadoc root URLs for these libraries.
;; Package jtags now supports both http URLs and file URLs.
;;
;; If you want to use the jtags submenu, set `jtags-display-menu-flag' to
;; non-nil. If this variable is non-nil, the jtags submenu will be displayed
;; when jtags mode is active.
;;
;; You can customize all the variables above, as well as the faces used in
;; member completion. Type `M-x customize-group' and enter group \"jtags\" for
;; the jtags mode variables, or \"etags\" for the tags table list.
;;
;; The jtags package defines four key bindings in the `jtags-mode-map':
;;
;; - C-,   is bound to `jtags-member-completion'
;; - M-,   is bound to `jtags-show-declaration'
;; - M-f1  is bound to `jtags-show-documentation'
;; - C-c , is bound to `jtags-update-this-tags-file'

;;
;; Well this was my first excursion into ELisp programmming.  It didn't go too badly once
;; I fiddled around with a bunch of the functions.
;;
;; The process of getting the path to a JSON value at point starts with
;; a call to the jsons-print-path function.
;;
;; It works by parsing the current buffer into a list of parse tree nodes
;; if the buffer hasn't already been parsed in the current Emacs session.
;; While parsing, the region occupied by the node is recorded into the
;; jsons-parsed-regions hash table as a list.The list contains the location
;; of the first character occupied by the node, the location of the last
;; character occupied, and the path to the node.  The parse tree is also stored
;; in the jsons-parsed list for possible future use.
;;
;; Once the buffer has been parsed, the node at point is looked up in the
;; jsons-curr-region list, which is the list of regions described in the
;; previous paragraph for the current buffer.  If point is not in one of these
;; interval ranges nil is returned, otherwise the path to the value is returned
;; in the form [<key-string>] for objects, and [<loc-int>] for arrays.
;; eg: ['value1'][0]['value2'] gets the array at with name value1, then gets the
;; 0th element of the array (another object), then gets the value at 'value2'.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; IMPORTANT: Works ONLY in Emacs 24 due to the use of the lexical-binding variable.
;;
;; To install add the json-snatcher.el file to your load-path, and
;; add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;(require 'json-snatcher)
;; (defun js-mode-bindings ()
;;   \"Sets a hotkey for using the json-snatcher plugin.\"

;; (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'js-mode-bindings)
;; (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook 'js-mode-bindings)
;;
;; This binds the key to snatch the path to the JSON value to C-c C-g only
;; when either JS mode, or JS2 mode is active on a buffer ending with
;; the .json extension.

;; This package provides a quick way to look up any Javadoc
;; documentation from Emacs, using your browser to display the
;; information. Since the mechanism is already there, java-import.el
;; provides the completing function `add-java-import' for quickly
;; adding an import to a source file.

;; This mode stores database and index information in
;; `javadoc-lookup-cache-dir'.

;; Indexing:

;; Give `javadoc-lookup' your root Java documentation directories. It
;; will scan and index those directories, exposing them to
;; `javadoc-lookup'. Multiple directories can be provided at once, for
;; example,

;;   (javadoc-add-roots \"/usr/share/doc/openjdk-6-jdk/api\"
;;                      \"~/src/project/doc\")

;; If you haven't loaded the core Java Javadoc, it will load a
;; pre-made database for you, which indexes the official website.

;; More conveniently, you can list Maven artifacts to index,

;;   (javadoc-add-artifacts [org.lwjgl.lwjgl lwjgl \"2.8.2\"]
;;                          [com.nullprogram native-guide \"0.2\"]
;;                          [org.apache.commons commons-math3 \"3.0\"])

;; Browser configuration:

;; To view documentation, the browser is launched with `browse-url'.
;; This may require setting `browse-url-browser-function' in order to
;; select the proper browser. For example,

;;   (setq browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-firefox)

;; This package defines the function `iy-go-to-char' which behaves like \"f\" in
;; vim, and `iy-go-up-to-char` like \"t\" in vim.  It reads a char and go the
;; next Nth occurence of the char.  User can continue such search using that
;; char key.

;; To use, make sure this file is on your `load-path' and put the
;; following in your .emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'iy-go-to-char)
;;
;; To make `iy-go-to-char' works better with `multiple-cursors', add
;; `iy-go-to-char-start-pos' to `mc/cursor-specific-vars' when mc is loaded:
;;
;;     (add-to-list 'mc/cursor-specific-vars 'iy-go-to-char-start-pos)
;;
;; Then you can bind functions like:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c f\") 'iy-go-to-char)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c F\") 'iy-go-to-char-backward)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c ;\") 'iy-go-to-or-up-to-continue)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c ,\") 'iy-go-to-or-up-to-continue-backward)
;;
;; Or if you prefer up-to (vim \"t\") versions:
;;
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c f\") 'iy-go-up-to-char)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c F\") 'iy-go-up-to-char-backward)
;;
;; You also can bind go-to methods and up-to methods to different keys.
;;
;; Except repeating the char key, followings keys are defined before
;; quitting the search:
;;
;;    ;   -- search forward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-forward'
;;
;;    ,   -- search backward the char, customizable:
;;           `iy-go-to-char-key-backward'
;;
;;    C-g -- quit
;;
;;    C-s -- start `isearch-forward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-r -- start `isearch-backward' using char as initial search
;;           string
;;
;;    C-w -- quit and kill region between start and current point.  If region is
;;           activated before search, then use the original mark instead of the
;;           start position.
;;
;;    M-w -- quit and save region between start and current point.  If region is
;;           activated before search, use the mark instead of start position.
;;
;; All other keys will quit the search.  Then the key event is
;; intepreted in the original environment before search.
;;
;; if the search quits because of error or using \"C-g\", point is set
;; back to the start position.  Otherwise, point is not change and the
;; start position is set as marker.  So you can use \"C-x C-x\" back to
;; that position.

;; `iy-go-to-char-backward' search backward by default.  Also the search can
;; cross lines.  To continue search last char, use `iy-go-to-char-continue' and
;; `iy-go-to-char-continue-backward'.

;; `isend-mode' is an Emacs extension allowing interaction with code
;; interpreters in `ansi-term' or `term' buffers. Some language-specific
;; modes (e.g. `python-mode') already provide similar features; `isend-mode'
;; does the same in a language-agnostic way.


;; Basic usage:

;; 1. Open an `ansi-term' buffer where the interpreter will live.
;;    For example:
;;
;;      M-x ansi-term RET /bin/sh RET

;; 2. Open a buffer with the code you want to execute, and associate it
;;    to the interpreter buffer using the `isend-associate' command (also
;;    aliased to `isend'). For example:
;;
;;      M-x isend-associate RET *ansi-term* RET

;; 3. Press C-RET (or M-x `isend-send') to send the current line to the
;;    interpreter. If the region is active, all lines spanned by the region
;;    will be sent (i.e. no line will be only partially sent). Point is
;;    then moved to the next non-empty line (but see configuration variable
;;    `isend-skip-empty-lines').

;;
;;; Overview of Features ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  * You can search within text-property or overlay-property zpnes of
;;    the buffer or active region.  Example: search within zones
;;    having a `face' text property with a value of
;;    `font-lock-comment-face' or `font-lock-string-face'.
;;
;;  * The basic commands for searching propertied zones are
;;    `isearchp-property-forward' and
;;    `isearchp-property-forward-regexp', and their backward
;;    counterparts.  By default, you are prompted for the property
;;    type (`text' or `overlay'), the property, and the property
;;    values (e.g., a list of faces, for property `face').  These
;;    commands are bound to `C-t' and `C-M-t', respectively, during
;;    Isearch.
;;
;;  * Besides relying on other code to set `face' and other text
;;    properties for use with `C-t', you can use command
;;    `isearchp-put-prop-on-region' (outside of Isearch) to add a text
;;    property to a zone of text.  By default, it applies the last
;;    property and value whose zones you searched using `C-t', but a
;;    prefix arg lets you specify the property and value to apply.
;;    This gives you an interactive way to set up zones for
;;    text-property search (`C-t').  For property `face', empty input
;;    removes all faces from the region.
;;
;;  * You can search zones of text/overlays that have a given
;;    property, as described above, or you can search the complement:
;;    the zones that do *NOT* have a given property.  You can toggle
;;    this search-domain complementing at any time during Isearch,
;;    using `C-M-~' (command `isearchp-toggle-complementing-domain').
;;
;;  * When you search propertied zones, the non-searchable zones are
;;    dimmed, to make the searchable areas stand out.  Option
;;    `isearchp-dim-non-prop-zones-flag' controls whether such dimming
;;    occurs.  You can toggle it anytime during Isearch, using `C-M-D'
;;    (aka `C-M-S-d').  Option `isearchp-dimming-color' defines the
;;    dimming behavior.  It specifies a given background color to use
;;    always, or it specifies that the current background color is to
;;    be dimmed a given amount.
;;
;;  * You can search the zones of text that match a given regexp,
;;    using command `isearchp-regexp-context-search'.  This is
;;    equivalent to using command `isearchp-regexp-define-contexts',
;;    which marks such zones with a text property, and then using
;;    command `isearchp-property-forward' (`C-t' during Isearch).
;;
;;  * You can search the text of THINGS of various kind (sexps, lists,
;;    defuns, lines, pages, sentences, filenames, strings, comments,
;;    xml/html elements, symbols,...), using command `isearchp-thing'.
;;    This is equivalent to using command
;;    `isearchp-thing-define-contexts', which marks such zones with a
;;    text property, and then using `isearchp-property-forward'.
;;
;;  * Not related to searching, but you can also move forward and
;;    backward among things of a given kind, using the repeatable
;;    commands `isearchp-next-visible-thing' and
;;    `isearchp-previous-visible-thing'.  For best results I strongly
;;    recommend that you also use library `thingatpt+.el'.  It
;;    enhances the vanilla treatment of THINGS and fixes various
;;    vanilla thing-at-point bugs.
;;
;;  * You can search the text of Emacs-Lisp definitions of different
;;    kinds, using commands `isearchp-imenu',
;;    `isearchp-imenu-command', `isearchp-imenu-macro', and
;;    `isearchp-imenu-non-interactive-function'.  Since Imenu is based
;;    on regexps that recognize definitions, these commands are based
;;    on the behavior of `isearchp-regexp-context-search'.
;;
;;  * You can remove properties from text or overlays using commands
;;    `isearchp-remove-property' and `isearchp-remove-all-properties'.
;;    By default, the latter removes only properties whose names begin
;;    with `isearchp-'.  These are the properties inserted
;;    automatically by the commands of this library, when you do not
;;    specify a property.
;;
;;  * You can hide or show code comments during Isearch, using `M-;'
;;    (command `isearchp-toggle-hiding-comments').  You can toggle
;;    ignoring comments during Isearch, using `C-M-;' (command
;;    `isearchp-toggle-ignoring-comments').

;;(@* \"Overview of Features\")
;;
;;; Overview of Features ---------------------------------------------
;;
;;  * Case-sensitivity is indicated in the mode line minor-mode
;;    lighter: `ISEARCH' for case-insensitive; `Isearch' for
;;    case-sensitive.
;;
;;  * Highlighting of the mode-line minor-mode lighter when search has
;;    wrapped around (Emacs 24+ only).
;;
;;  * Highlighting of parts of the prompt, to indicate the type of
;;    search: regexp, word, multiple-buffer, and whether searching has
;;    wrapped around the buffer (Emacs 22+ only).
;;
;;  * Optional limiting of search to the active region, controlled by
;;    option `isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag'.  Deactivation of the
;;    active region, controlled by option
;;    `isearchp-deactivate-region-flag'.  Both of these are available
;;    for Emacs 24.3 and later.  You can use `C-x n' (command
;;    `isearchp-toggle-region-restriction') during search to toggle
;;    `isearchp-restrict-to-region-flag'.
;;
;;    NOTE: For search to be limited to the active region in Info, you
;;    must also use library `info+.el'.
;;
;;  * Option and commands to let you select the last target occurrence
;;    (set the region around it):
;;
;;    - Option `isearchp-set-region-flag' - Non-`nil' means
;;      automatically set the region around the last search target.
;;    - Command `isearchp-toggle-set-region', bound to `C-SPC' during
;;      isearch - toggle `isearchp-set-region-flag'.
;;    - Command `set-region-around-search-target' - manually set the
;;      region around the last search target.
;;
;;  * When you visit a search hit, you can perform an action on it.
;;    Use `C-M-RET' (command `isearchp-act-on-demand' - Emacs 22+
;;    only) to invoke the action function that is the value of option
;;    `isearchp-on-demand-action-function'.  That function is passed
;;    the current search-hit string and its start and end positions in
;;    the buffer.  Search moves to the next hit in the same search
;;    direction, so just repeating `C-M-RET' carries out the action on
;;    subsequent hits.
;;
;;  * The default value of `isearchp-on-demand-action-function' is
;;    function `isearchp-replace-on-demand', which replaces the search
;;    hit.  This means that you can replace (or delete) chosen search
;;    hits on demand.
;;
;;    By default, the replacement string is empty, so with no prefix
;;    argument the action is to delete the search hit (replace it with
;;    nothing).
;;
;;    With a prefix arg, `isearchp-replace-on-demand' prompts for the
;;    replacement, which is used thereafter until you again use a
;;    prefix arg.  Since you can use a prefix arg at any time, you can
;;    provide different replacements for different search hits.  When
;;    prompted, if you clear the minibuffer and hit `RET', hit
;;    replacement just becomes search-hit deletion.
;;
;;    . With a plain prefix arg (`C-u') or a numeric prefix arg of
;;      value 1 (e.g. `C-1'), `isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces
;;      only the current search hit.
;;
;;    . With a negative prefix arg (e.g. `M--'),
;;      `isearchp-replace-on-demand' changes searching so that it also
;;      replaces.  That is, the search key (e.g., `C-s') then acts the
;;      same as `C-M-RET'.  (You can cancel this by using a
;;      non-negative prefix arg or by quitting and restarting
;;      Isearch.)
;;
;;    . With a positive prefix arg N (e.g. `C-8' or `C-u 200'),
;;      `isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces N search hits (but it
;;      stops at the search limit, if reached).
;;
;;    . With a zero prefix arg (e.g. `C-0),
;;      `isearchp-replace-on-demand' replaces *all* remaining search
;;      hits (up to the search limit).
;;
;;    (NOTE: To use a prefix arg within Isearch, you must set
;;    `isearch-allow-prefix' (if available) or `isearch-allow-scroll'
;;    to non-nil.)
;;
;;  * When you use on-demand replacement (with `C-M-RET') the
;;    replacement text can be either inserted literally, as is, or
;;    interpreted as in `query-replace-regexp'.  In the latter case,
;;    you can use `\\&', `\\=\\N', `\\#', `\\,' and `\\?'.
;;
;;    For example, suppose you use a regexp-search pattern of
;;    `\\(e\\)\\|a' and a replacement pattern of `\\,(if \\1 \"a\" \"e\")'.
;;    Each `C-M-RET' will then swap `e' for `a' and vice versa.
;;
;;    See the doc for `query-replace-regexp' and node `Regexp Replace'
;;    of the Emacs manual for more information.
;;
;;    (Note that `\\?' is supported, but it is not very useful in this
;;    context, because it prompts you to edit the result each time you
;;    hit `C-M-RET'.  Instead, use `C-u C-M-RET' whenever you want to
;;    change (edit) the replacement pattern.)
;;
;;  * You can use `C-M-`' (`isearchp-toggle-literal-replacement')
;;    anytime during Isearch to toggle whether replacement text is
;;    used literally or interpreted per the special regexp-replacement
;;    constructs.
;;
;;    Note that the use of the special regexp replacement patterns is
;;    unrelated to the kind of incremental search: literal string
;;    search or regexp search.  Just remember that the way to switch
;;    on/off the special behavior of `\\&' and so on is to use `C-M-`'.
;;
;;  * The value of variable `isearchp-noprompt-action-function' is a
;;    function that is invoked automatically, after you visit each
;;    search hit.  The function is called with no arguments.  It
;;    cannot use the minibuffer, but it can modify buffer contents.
;;    The variable is reset to `nil' when you quit Isearch.  As an
;;    example of use, command `isearchp-replace-on-demand' with a
;;    negative prefix arg sets this to `isearchp-replace-match', which
;;    causes automatic replacement each time you visit a search hit.
;;
;;  * Hook `isearchp-nomodify-action-hook' (Emacs 22+ only) is also
;;    run after each search visit.  Its functions also must accept the
;;    same arguments as `isearchp-act-on-demand'.  The functions can
;;    use the minibuffer, but they must not update the buffer text (in
;;    a way noticeable by Isearch), or else that will likely lead to a
;;    call-stack overflow.  This is because they are called with
;;    Isearch suspended during `isearch-update' (which can itself be
;;    invoked by the action...).
;;
;;  * Option (`isearchp-regexp-quote-yank-flag') and command
;;    (`isearchp-toggle-regexp-quote-yank', bound to `C-`') to toggle
;;    quoting (escaping) of regexp special characters.  With escaping
;;    turned off, you can yank text such as `^\\*.*' without it being
;;    transformed to `\\^\\\\\\*\\.\\*'.
;;
;;  * `M-g' (`isearchp-retrieve-last-quit-search') yanks the last
;;    successful search string (regexp or plain) from when you last
;;    hit `C-g' in Isearch.  Sometimes you search for something but
;;    abandon the search - you just want to check the locations of
;;    something, without staying at any of them.  Afterward, if you
;;    want to find them again, use `M-g'.  This yanks that search
;;    string, so you can append it to whatever you are already
;;    searching for.
;;
;;  * `C-M-y' (`isearch-yank-secondary') yanks the secondary selection
;;    into the search string, if you also use library `second-sel.el'.
;;
;;  * `C-c' (`isearchp-yank-char') yanks successive characters onto
;;    the search string.
;;
;;  * `C-_' (`isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char') yanks successive symbols
;;    (or words or subwords or chars) into the search string.
;;
;;  * `C-(' (`isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char') yanks successive
;;    sexps (or symbols or words or subwords or chars) into the search
;;    string.
;;
;;  * `M-w' (`isearchp-kill-ring-save') copies the current search
;;    string to the kill ring.  You can then, for example, use `C-s
;;    M-y' to search for the same thing in another Emacs session.
;;
;;    (I use this all the time, but you might not use multiple Emacs
;;    sessions.)  Note that if you did not have this feature then you
;;    would need to select the search-string text (in the text buffer
;;    or in the `M-e' Isearch edit buffer) and copy it to the kill
;;    ring. (Note: `M-w' used to toggle word search, but
;;    `isearch-toggle-word' is now `M-s w'.)
;;
;;  * All commands that yank text onto the search string are bound to
;;    keys with prefix `C-y' (in addition to any other Isearch
;;    bindings):
;;
;;      `C-y C-_'   isearchp-yank-symbol-or-char
;;      `C-y C-('   isearchp-yank-sexp-symbol-or-char
;;      `C-y C-2'   isearch-yank-secondary
;;      `C-y C-c'   isearchp-yank-char
;;      `C-y C-e'   isearchp-yank-line
;;      `C-y C-w'   isearchp-yank-word-or-char
;;      `C-y C-y'   isearch-yank-kill
;;      `C-y M-y'   isearch-yank-pop
;;
;;    You can repeat any of these for which it makes sense (i.e., all
;;    except `isearch-yank-secondary', `isearch-yank-kill', and
;;    `isearch-yank-pop') by just repeating the last key.  For
;;    example: `C-y C-e C-e C-e' adds the text up to the end of three
;;    lines.
;;
;;  * `C-x 8 RET' (`isearch-char-by-name') reads the name of a Unicode
;;    character with completion and appends it to the search string.
;;    Same thing when editing the search string (i.e., after `M-e').
;;    This is part of GNU Emacs starting with Emacs 24.4.
;;
;;  * `C-x o' (`isearchp-open-recursive-edit') opens a recursive
;;    editing session, where you can do anything you like (including
;;    search for something different).  Using `C-M-c' closes the
;;    recursive editing session and resumes the search (from the
;;    current position when you hit `C-M-c').
;;
;;  * Highlighting of the mismatched portion of your search string in
;;    the minibuffer.  This is the portion that is removed if you do
;;    `C-g', or removed/replaced automatically if you use `M-k' (see
;;    next).  I added this feature to GNU Emacs 23.1.
;;
;;  * `C-g' after successfully finding matches restores not only the
;;    original position but also its relative position in the window.
;;    IOW, you get back to what you saw before searching.  Fixes Emacs
;;    bug #12253 for Isearch.
;;
;;  * `M-k' (`isearchp-cycle-mismatch-removal') cycles automatic
;;    removal or replacement of the input portion that does not match,
;;    bound to .  The behavior is controlled by the value of option
;;    `isearchp-drop-mismatch':
;;
;;    `replace-last' - Your current input replaces the last mismatched
;;                     text.  You can always see your last input, even
;;                     if it is a mismatch.  And it is available for
;;                     editing using `M-e'.
;;    nil            - Your current input is appended, even if the
;;                     previous input has a mismatched portion.
;;    anything else  - Your current input is ignored (removed) if it
;;                     causes a mismatch.  The search string always
;;                     has successful matches.
;;
;;  * Non-`nil' option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag', which you can
;;    toggle using `M-s v' (`isearchp-toggle-option-toggle'),
;;    determines whether commands that toggle behavior also toggle an
;;    associated user option.  For such commands, a prefix argument
;;    flips the behavior, as if `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' were
;;    toggled temporarily.  Currently this feature applies to toggles
;;    `M-c' (case-sensitivity) and `M-s i' (matching hidden text).
;;
;;  * `M-c' (`isearch-toggle-case-fold') toggles case sensitivity.  If
;;    option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-nil then it toggles
;;    option `isearchp-case-fold' to change the sensitivity from now
;;    on.  Otherwise, the option value is not changed, so the effect
;;    is for the current search only.
;;
;;  * `M-s i' (`isearch-toggle-invisible') toggles invisible-text
;;    sensitivity.  If option `isearchp-toggle-option-flag' is non-nil
;;    then it toggles option `search-invisible' to change the
;;    sensitivity from now on.  Otherwise, the option value is not
;;    changed, so the effect is for the current search only.
;;
;;  * `C-+' (`isearchp-toggle-search-invisible') toggles the value of
;;    option `search-invisible'.  The effect is like that of `M-s i'
;;    with no prefix argument and with non-nil
;;    `isearchp-toggle-option-flag'.
;;
;;  * Other bindings during Isearch:
;;
;;    - `next', `prior' repeat the last Isearch forward and backward
;;      (easier than using the chords `C-s', `C-r').
;;    - `C-end' - go to the longest line.  Repeat to go to the longest
;;      line following that one in the buffer.  As usual, `C-g' puts
;;      you back where you started.  This binding is made only if you
;;      also use `misc-cmds.el'.
;;    - `C-h' provides help on Isearch while searsching.  This library
;;      also redefines `isearch-mode-help' so that it lists all
;;      Isearch bindings and ends Isearch properly.
;;
;;  * `M-e' (`isearch-edit-string') automatically puts the cursor at
;;    the first mismatch position in the search string, for easy
;;    editing.  Whereas `C-g' (see also `M-k') removes all of the
;;    mismatch, this feature lets you change or insert a character or
;;    two, without losing the rest of the search string.
;;
;;  * A user option, `isearchp-initiate-edit-commands', that specifies
;;    commands whose keys will not exit Isearch but will instead
;;    initiate editing of the search string.  For example, if
;;    `backward-char' is included in the list then `C-b' and `left'
;;    will just move the cursor backward over the search string so you
;;    can change, delete, or insert chars in the middle somewhere.
;;    This makes the search string more minibuffer-like.
;;
;;  * You can, by default, select text with the mouse, then hit `C-s'
;;    etc. to search for it.  This is controlled by user option
;;    `isearchp-mouse-2-flag'.
;;
;;  If you have Emacs 23 or later then I recommend that you also use
;;  the companion library, `isearch-prop.el'.  If it is in your
;;  `load-path' then it will be loaded by `isearch+.el'.  It lets you
;;  limit incremental searching to contexts that you define.
;;
;;  Example: search within zones having a `face' text property with a
;;  value of `font-lock-comment-face' or `font-lock-string-face'.
;;  Search overlays or text properties.
;;
;;  Besides relying on existing text properties such as `face' for
;;  contexts to search, you can use command
;;  `isearchp-put-prop-on-region' to add any text property to the
;;  region.  This gives you an easy way to set up contexts for
;;  text-property search.  For property `face', empty input to
;;  `isearchp-put-prop-on-region' removes all faces from the region.

;; Interface for IETF RFC document.
;;
;; This package use some code from `rfcview.el'.
;; Thanks \"Neil W.  Van Dyke\"!
;;
;; The features this package provide:
;;
;; * Format RFC document for easy reading.
;; * Single keystroke for fast view.
;; * Render status switch.
;; * Smart table and content switch.
;; * Visit RFC link around point.
;; * Jump to RFC reference around point.
;; * Download RFC document *asynchronous*.
;;
;; Below are commands you can use:
;;
;; `irfc-render-toggle'         Toggle render status with RFC buffer.
;; `irfc-quit'                  Quit RFC buffer.
;; `irfc-visit'                 Ask for RFC number and visit document.
;; `irfc-reference-goto'        Ask for RFC reference and jump to it.
;; `irfc-head-goto'             Ask for heading name and jump to it.
;; `irfc-head-number-goto'      Ask for heading number and jump to it.
;; `irfc-follow'                Visit RFC document around point.
;; `irfc-table-jump'            Switch between table and content.
;; `irfc-page-goto'             Goto page.
;; `irfc-page-next'             Jump next page.
;; `irfc-page-prev'             Jump previous page.
;; `irfc-page-first'            Jump first page.
;; `irfc-page-last'             Jump last page.

;; `irfc-scroll-up-one-line'    Scroll up one line.
;; `irfc-scroll-down-one-line'  Scroll down one line.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; You can use command `irfc-render-toggle' to toggle render status.
;;
;; Command `irfc-table-jump' can switch between table and content,
;; example you stay cursor at *table*, and type \"G\" will jump corresponding
;; content in buffer, alike, you can stay at any content and type \"G\"
;; will jump corresponding table item.
;;
;; Command `irfc-follow' will visit RFC document around point,
;; example you stay cursor at \"[RFC3986]\", and type \"o\" will
;; open rfc3986.txt in storage directory.  If have not found
;; this file in directory, will download from `http://www.ietf.org/rfc/'
;; and open it when download complete.
;;
;; And command \342\200\230irfc-follow\342\200\231 can also use at title of RFC document.
;; Example rfc3986.txt contain \342\200\234Obsoletes: 2732, 2396, 1808\342\200\235 at title,
;; you can move cursor to \342\200\2342732\342\200\235 and type \342\200\234o\342\200\235 will visit RFC 2732 document.

;;        \342\200\234Obsoletes:\342\200\235
;;
;; You can use command `irfc-rfc-link-next' or `irfc-rfc-link-prev'
;; to jump next or previous RFC link in document.
;;
;; Command `irfc-visit' will ask the user for a RFC number and will
;; visit that document, either from `irfc-directory', if exists, or by
;; downloading it.  This command can serve as entry point for Irfc,
;; to go to a RFC without having to visit the file or remember
;; whether it is already in `irfc-directory'.
;; And if you visit same document with your previous type, so just
;; hit RET, and don't need type RFC document number.
;;
;; Command `irfc-reference-goto' will ask the user for a reference
;; number and will jump to that citation in the Normative
;; References/Informative References heading.
;;
;; Command `irfc-head-goto' will ask the user for a heading name and
;; will jump to that heading.  Completion list in minibuffer is
;; available.
;;
;; Command `irfc-head-number-goto' will ask the user for a heading

;;  ***** NOTE: The following behavior defined in `info.el'
;;              has been changed.
;;
;;  \"*info\" has been removed from `same-window-buffer-names', so that
;;  a separate window can be used if the user so chooses.
;;
;;
;;  Suggestion: Use a medium-dark background for Info.  Try, for
;;  example, setting the background to \"LightSteelBlue\" in your
;;  `~/.emacs' file.  You can do this as follows:
;;
;;         (setq special-display-buffer-names
;;               (cons '(\"*info*\" (background-color . \"LightSteelBlue\"))
;;                     special-display-buffer-names))
;;
;;  Alternatively, you can change the background value of
;;  `special-display-frame-alist' and set `special-display-regexps' to
;;  something matching \"*info*\":
;;
;;         (setq special-display-frame-alist
;;               (cons '(background-color . \"LightSteelBlue\")
;;                     special-display-frame-alist))
;;         (setq special-display-regexps '(\"[ ]?[*][^*]+[*]\"))
;;
;;  If you do use a medium-dark background for Info, consider
;;  customizing face to a lighter foreground color - I use \"Yellow\".
;;
;;  Also, consider customizing face `link' to remove its underline
;;  attribute.
;;
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here for Info-mode:
;;
;;    `?'              `describe-mode' (replaces `Info-summary')
;;    `+'              `Info-merge-subnodes'
;;    `.'              `Info-save-current-node'
;;    `a'              `info-apropos'
;;    `v'              `Info-virtual-book'
;;    `mouse-4'        `Info-history-back'
;;    `mouse-5'        `Info-history-forward'
;;    `S-down-mouse-2' `Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node-new-window'
;;    `S-RET'          `Info-follow-nearest-node-new-window'
;;
;;  The following bindings are made here for merged Info buffers:
;;
;;    `.'              `beginning-of-buffer'
;;    `b'              `beginning-of-buffer'
;;    `q'              `quit-window'
;;    `s'              `nonincremental-re-search-forward'
;;    `M-s'            `nonincremental-re-search-forward'
;;    `TAB'            `Info-next-reference'
;;    `ESC TAB'        `Info-prev-reference'
;;
;;
;;
;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `info.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load \"info\" '(require 'info+))

A php process can be fired up with M-x inf-php.

Customisation: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on comint-mode-hook and
inf-php-mode-hook (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior php process from other buffers containing
Php source.
    php-switch-to-inf switches the current buffer to the php process buffer.
    php-send-definition sends the current definition to the php process.
    php-send-region sends the current region to the php process.

    php-send-definition-and-go, php-send-region-and-go,
        switch to the php process buffer after sending their text.

Commands:
Return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
Return before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Tab indents for php; with arugment, shifts rest
    of expression rigidly with the current line.
C-M-q does Tab on each line starting within following expression.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.  # start comments.

;; impatient-mode is a minor mode that publishes the live buffer
;; through the local simple-httpd server under /imp/<buffer-name>. To
;; unpublish a buffer, toggle impatient-mode off.

;; Start the simple-httpd server (`httpd-start') and visit /imp/ on
;; the local server. There will be a listing of all the buffers that
;; currently have impatient-mode enabled. This is likely to be found
;; here:

;;   http://localhost:8080/imp/

;; Except for html-mode buffers, buffers will be prettied up with
;; htmlize before being sent to clients. This can be toggled at any
;; time with `imp-toggle-htmlize'.

;; Because html-mode buffers are sent raw, you can use impatient-mode
;; see your edits to an HTML document live! This is perhaps the
;; primary motivation of this mode.

;; To receive updates the browser issues a long poll on the client
;; waiting for the buffer to change -- server push. The response
;; happens in an `after-change-functions' hook. Buffers that do not
;; run these hooks will not be displayed live to clients.

;; The `igrep' command is like `grep' except that it takes three
;; required arguments (PROGRAM, REGEX, and FILES) and an optional
;; argument (OPTIONS) instead of just one argument (COMMAND).  The
;; analogous `egrep' and `fgrep' commands are also defined for
;; convenience.
;; 
;; The `igrep-find' command is like `igrep' except that it uses `find`
;; to recursively `grep` a directory.  The analogous `egrep-find' and
;; `fgrep-find' commands are also defined for convenience.
;; 
;; When called interactively, `igrep' and `igrep-find' (and their
;; analogues) provide defaults for the REGEX and FILES arguments based
;; on the current word and the visited file name (if the `igrep-regex-
;; default' and `igrep-files-default' options are set, respectively).
;; The `igrep-insert-default-key' option allows the default value to be
;; inserted into the minibuffer for editing; since Emacs 20 provides
;; that via the minibuffer history, it's only enabled for older
;; versions by default. Other options that control the user interface
;; are `igrep-insert-default-directory', `igrep-read-options', `igrep-
;; read-multiple-files', `igrep-verbose-prompts', `igrep-save-buffers',
;; and `igrep-menu-bar'.
;; 
;; Besides the basic `igrep-program' and `igrep-find-program' global
;; variables, other variables control the syntax of the `grep` and
;; `find` shell commands that are executed: `igrep-options', `igrep-
;; regex-option', `igrep-case-fold-search', `igrep-find-prune-clause',
;; `igrep-find-file-clause', and `igrep-find-use-xargs'.
;; 
;; The `igrep-use-zgrep' user option controls whether the corresponding
;; GNU (gzip) \"zPROGRAM\" script is used, to `grep` compressed files.
;; Special minibuffer history lists are maintained for the REGEX and
;; FILES arguments.
;; 
;; The `agrep' and `agrep-find' commands are interfaces to the
;; approximate `grep` utility, which is distributed with the `glimpse'
;; indexing and query tool (available from http://www.tgries.de/agrep/).
;; 
;; `grep' itself can be advised to provide the `igrep' interface when
;; it is invoked interactively (but still use the original argument
;; list when it is called from Emacs Lisp), via the `igrep-insinuate'
;; command.  `igrep-insinuate' also defines `grep-find' as an alias for
;; `igrep-find', `dired-do-grep' and `dired-do-grep-find' as aliases
;; for `dired-do-igrep' and `dired-do-igrep-find', and `Buffer-menu-
;; grep' as an alias for `Buffer-menu-igrep'.
;; 
;; When run interactively from Dired mode, the various `igrep' commands
;; provide defaults for the REGEX and FILES arguments that are based on
;; the visited directory (including any inserted subdirectories) and
;; the current file.  The alternative `dired-do-igrep' and `dired-do-
;; igrep-find' commands respect the `dired-do-*' command conventions: a
;; prefix argument is interpreted as the number of succeeding files to
;; `grep`, otherwise all the marked files are `grep`ed.
;; 
;; The `igrep-visited-files' command provides a simple way to `grep`
;; just those files that are being visited in buffers.  The `Buffer-
;; menu-igrep' command does the same thing, for buffers marked for
;; selection in Buffer Menu mode.

;; Installation:
;; 
;; 1. Put this file in a directory that is a member of load-path, and
;;    byte-compile it (e.g. with `M-x byte-compile-file') for better
;;    performance.  You can ignore any warnings about references to free
;;    variables and \"not known to be defined\" functions.
;; 2. Put these forms in default.el or ~/.emacs:
;;    (autoload 'igrep \"igrep\"
;;       \"*Run `grep` PROGRAM to match REGEX in FILES...\" t)
;;    (autoload 'igrep-find \"igrep\"
;;       \"*Run `grep` via `find`...\" t)

;;    (autoload 'igrep-insinuate \"igrep\"
;;      \"Define `grep' aliases for the corresponding `igrep' commands.\" t)
;; 2. a. For completeness, you can add these forms as well:
;;    (autoload 'grep \"igrep\"
;;       \"*Run `grep` PROGRAM to match REGEX in FILES...\" t)
;;    (autoload 'egrep \"igrep\"
;;       \"*Run `egrep`...\" t)

;; 3. If you are running Windows 95/NT, you should install findutils
;;    and grep from release 17.1 (or higher) of the Cygnus GNU-Win32
;;    distribution (http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/).

;; Usage:
;; 
;; These igrep commands accept 1, 2, or 3 `C-u' prefix arguments:
;; 	M-x igrep		M-x igrep-find
;; 	M-x  grep		M-x  grep-find	[after `M-x igrep-insinuate']
;; 	M-x egrep		M-x egrep-find
;; 	M-x fgrep		M-x fgrep-find
;; 	M-x agrep		M-x agrep-find
;; 
;; These igrep commands accept a single `C-u' prefix argument:
;; 	M-x igrep-visited-files
;; 	M-x Buffer-menu-igrep	[in the *Buffer List* buffer]
;; 
;; These igrep commands interpret a prefix argument like the Emacs
;; `dired-do-*' commands:
;; 	M-x dired-do-igrep	M-x dired-do-igrep-find
;; 	M-x  dired-do-grep	M-x  dired-do-grep-find	[after `M-x
;; 							 igrep-insinuate']
;; 
;; These Emacs commands can be used after any igrep command:
;; 	C-x ` (M-x next-error)
;; 	C-c C-c (M-x compile-goto-error)	[in the *igrep* buffer]

;; Customization examples:
;; 
;; To ignore case by default:
;; 	(setq igrep-options \"-i\")
;; or:
;; 	(setq igrep-case-fold-search t)
;; To search subdirectories by default:
;; 	(setq igrep-find t)
;; To search files with the GNU (gzip) zgrep script:
;; 	(setq igrep-use-zgrep t)
;; or define new igrep commands (this works for zegrep and zfgrep as well):
;; 	(igrep-define zgrep)		; M-x zgrep
;; 	(igrep-find-define zgrep)	; M-x zgrep-find
;; To search \"*.[ch]\" files by default in C mode:
;; 	(put 'igrep-files-default 'c-mode
;; 	     (lambda () \"*.[ch]\"))
;; To disable the default search regex and/or files pattern, except for
;; specific modes:
;; 	(setq igrep-regex-default 'ignore)
;; 	(setq igrep-files-default 'ignore)
;; To avoid exceeding some shells' limit on command argument length
;; (this only searches files in the current directory):
;; 	(setq igrep-find t
;; 	      igrep-find-prune-clause \"-type d \\\\! -name .\")

;; To do:
;; 1. Replace igrep-options with a table that maps igrep-program
;;    to the appropriate options, and/or support POSIX (egrep -> `grep -E`).
;; 2. Generalize support for the -prune find clause (e.g. -fstype nfs).
;; 3. Provide support for `glimpse`.

"]) (iflipb . [(20130331 1108) nil "interactively flip between recently visited buffers" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; iflipb lets you flip between recently visited buffers in a way that
;; resembles what Alt-(Shift-)TAB does in Microsoft Windows and other graphical
;; window managers. iflipb treats the buffer list as a stack, and (by design)
;; it doesn't wrap around. This means that when you have flipped to the last
;; buffer and continue, you don't get to the first buffer again. This is a good
;; thing. (If you disagree and want wrap-around, set iflipb-wrap-around to
;; non-nil.)
;;
;;
;; OPERATION
;; =========
;;
;; iflipb provides two commands: iflipb-next-buffer and iflipb-previous-buffer.
;;
;; iflipb-next-buffer behaves like Alt-TAB: it switches to the previously used
;; buffer, just like \"C-x b RET\" (or C-M-l in XEmacs). However, another
;; consecutive call to iflipb-next-buffer switches to the next buffer in the
;; buffer list, and so on. When such a consecutive call is made, the
;; skipped-over buffer is not regarded as visited.
;;
;; While flipping, the names of the most recent buffers are displayed in the
;; minibuffer, and the currently visited buffer is surrounded by square
;; brackets and marked with a bold face.
;;
;; A key thing to notice here is that iflipb displays the buffer contents after
;; each step forward/backwards (in addition to displaying the buffer names),
;; unlike for instance the buffer switching model of ido-mode where only the
;; buffer names are displayed.
;;
;; iflipb-previous-buffer behaves like Alt-Shift-TAB: it walks backwards in the
;; buffer list.
;;
;; Here is an illustration of what happens in a couple of different scenarios:
;;
;;                    Minibuffer    Actual
;;                    display       buffer list
;; --------------------------------------------
;; Original:                        A B C D E
;; Forward flip:      A [B] C D E   B A C D E
;; Forward flip:      A B [C] D E   C A B D E
;; Forward flip:      A B C [D] E   D A B C E
;;
;; Original:                        A B C D E
;; Forward flip:      A [B] C D E   B A C D E
;; Forward flip:      A B [C] D E   C A B D E
;; Backward flip:     A [B] C D E   B A C D E
;;
;; Original:                        A B C D E
;; Forward flip:      A [B] C D E   B A C D E
;; Forward flip:      A B [C] D E   C A B D E
;; [Edit buffer C]:                 C A B D E
;; Forward flip:      C [A] B D E   A C B D E
;;
;; iflipb by default ignores buffers whose names start with an asterisk or
;; space. You can give a prefix argument to iflipb-next-buffer to make it flip
;; between more buffers. See the documentation of the variables
;; iflipb-ignore-buffers and iflipb-always-ignore-buffers for how to change
;; this.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;; ============
;;
;; To load iflipb, store iflipb.el in your Emacs load path and put
;;
;;   (require 'iflipb)
;;
;; in your .emacs file or equivalent.
;;
;; This file does not install any key bindings for the two commands. I
;; personally use M-h and M-H (i.e., M-S-h) since I don't use the standard
;; binding of M-h (mark-paragraph) and M-h is quick and easy to press. To
;; install iflipb with M-h and M-H as keyboard bindings, put something like
;; this in your .emacs:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"M-h\") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"M-H\") 'iflipb-previous-buffer)
;;
;; Another alternative is to use C-tab and C-S-tab:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"<C-tab>\") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
;;   (global-set-key
;;    (if (featurep 'xemacs) (kbd \"<C-iso-left-tab>\") (kbd \"<C-S-iso-lefttab>\"))
;;     'iflipb-previous-buffer)
;;
;; Or perhaps use functions keys like F9 and F10:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"<f10>\") 'iflipb-next-buffer)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"<f9>\")  'iflipb-previous-buffer)
;;
;;
;; ABOUT
;; =====
;;
;; iflipb was inspired by cycle-buffer.el
;; <http://kellyfelkins.org/pub/cycle-buffer.el>. cycle-buffer.el has some more
;; features, but doesn't quite behave like I want, so I wrote my own simple
;; replacement.
;;
;; Have fun!

;; This package is an Emacs minor mode and allows you to edit one occurrence of
;; some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and simultaneously have
;; other occurrences edited in the same way.
;;
;; Normal scenario of iedit-mode is like:
;;
;; - Highlight certain contents - by press C-; (The default binding)
;;   All occurrences of a symbol, string in the buffer or a region may be
;;   highlighted corresponding to current mark, point and prefix argument.
;;   Refer to the document of `iedit-mode' for details.
;;
;; - Edit one of the occurrences
;;   The change is applied to other occurrences simultaneously.
;;
;; - Finish - by pressing C-; again
;;
;; You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the
;; buffer lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the
;; effect of a temporary `keep-lines' or `occur'.  To get this effect, hit C-'
;; when in Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.
;;
;; Renaming refactoring is convenient in Iedit mode
;;
;; - The symbol under point is selected as occurrence by default and only
;;   complete symbols are matched
;; - With digit prefix argument 0, only symbols in current function are matched
;; - Restricting symbols in current region can be done by pressing C-; again
;; - Last renaming refactoring is remembered and can be applied to other buffers
;;   later
;;
;; There are also some other facilities you may never think about.  Refer to the
;; document of function `iedit-mode' (C-h f iedit-mode RET) for more details.

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'ido-load-library)
;;     M-x ido-load-library RET
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Ido-load-library is an alternative to `load-library' which
;; uses `ido-completing-read' for completion against all
;; available libraries in your `load-path'.
;;
;; To use ido-load-library, place the ido-load-library.el file
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your
;; ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'ido-load-library)
;;
;; The interactive command `ido-load-library' is provided, though
;; not bound to any key.  It can be executed via
;;
;;     M-x ido-load-library
;;
;; or bound via something like
;;
;;     (define-key global-map (kbd \"C-c l\") 'ido-load-library)
;;
;; or safely aliased to `load-library'
;;
;;     (defalias 'load-library 'ido-load-library)
;;
;; The interactive command `ido-load-library-find' is also
;; provided.  Like `ido-load-library', it searches your
;; `load-path', but instead of loading the selected library,
;; it visits the file in a buffer.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET ido-load-library RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET ido RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     Defines the variable `library-name-history' outside of the
;;     `ido-load-library-' namespace.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.4-devel     : yes, at the time of writing

;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no
;;
;;     Uses if present: persistent-soft.el (Recommended)
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     When invalidating the disk cache, `ido-load-library' only checks
;;     whether `load-path' has changed, not whether new files were added
;;     to existing paths.  Workarounds:
;;
;;         1. Install libraries using ELPA/package.el, in which case this
;;            assumption always works.
;;         2. Wait for the cache to expire (7 days).
;;         3. Give universal prefix argument to `ido-load-library'
;;            to force invalidation of the cache.
;;
;;     Should not remove -autoloads and -pkg library names unless there
;;     is another name found with the same base.

;;  This file should be loaded after loading the standard GNU file
;;  `icomplete.el'.  So, in your `~/.emacs' file, do this:
;;  (eval-after-load \"icomplete\" '(progn (require 'icomplete+)))
;;
;;  Usage notes:
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 23 you can get icompletion of things like
;;    file names also.  See variable (non-option)
;;    `icomplete-with-completion-tables'.  If you set it to the
;;    (undocumented) value `t' then icompletion is available anytime
;;    the completion COLLECTION parameter is a function, which
;;    includes file-name completion.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24 you can specify the kinds of completion
;;    you want by customizing option `completion-category-overrides'
;;    for file names, buffer names, bookmark names, and so on.
;;
;;  * Starting with Emacs 24.4, Icomplete mode automatically binds
;;    keys that are otherwise useful in the minibuffer (for Isearch,
;;    symbol completion, etc.) to its own keys for cycling among
;;    icompletion candidates.  This is a BAD idea - see Emacs bug
;;    #13602.  Icomplete+ fixes this by having a separate mode that
;;    binds Icomplete keys, making that optional.  This is analogous
;;    to the difference between `cua-selection-mode' and `cua-mode'.
;;
;;    So with Icomplete+, just turning on Icomplete mode does not
;;    co-opt those keys taking them away from you for use in the
;;    minibuffer.  If you really want to do that then turn on
;;    `icomplete-cycling-mode' in addition to `icomplete-mode'.  And
;;    in that case, consider also choosing different keys to bind in
;;    `icomplete-minibuffer-map' from those that are bound by default.
;;
;;  (The first two features above are not particular to Icomplete+ -
;;  they are available also for vanilla Icomplete.)

;;
;;  Minibuffer input completion and cycling of completion candidates.
;;
;;  Input completion takes as input a string and returns a name that
;;  contains the input string.  This library enables minibuffer
;;  cycling of completion candidates, and provides additional support
;;  for input completion.
;;
;;  Two kinds of completion are offered here, which are distinguished
;;  by how the input string is matched against the completed name:
;;
;;   - Prefix completion - The input string is a prefix of the
;;                         completed name.  This is the usual Emacs
;;                         completion.
;;
;;   - Apropos completion - The input string is a regular expression
;;                          that matches somewhere (anywhere) within
;;                          the completed name.  You can think of the
;;                          name as having been returned by `apropos'
;;                          (except it also works for file and buffer
;;                          names).
;;
;;  Files `icicles-doc1.el' and `icicles-doc2.el' contain the doc for
;;  Icicles, including how to install and use Icicles.  You can also
;;  read the Icicles doc, in formatted form, on the Emacs-Wiki Web
;;  site: http://www.emacswiki.org/Icicles.  Emacs Wiki also has a few
;;  addtional pages about Icicles.  In particular, if you are new to
;;  Emacs, as well as Icicles, see this page:
;;  http://www.emacswiki.org/EmacsNewbieWithIcicles.
;;
;;  See also: Library `lacarte.el', which lets you execute menu
;;  commands, cycling and completing them.  It is not part of Icicles,
;;  but it is greatly enhanced by Icicles.

;;
;;  ******************
;;  NOTE: Whenever you update Icicles (i.e., download new versions of
;;  Icicles source files), I recommend that you do the following:
;;
;;      1. Delete all existing byte-compiled Icicles files
;;         (icicles*.elc).
;;      2. Load Icicles (`load-library' or `require').
;;      3. Byte-compile the source files.
;;
;;  In particular, always load `icicles-mac.el' (not
;;  `icicles-mac.elc') before you byte-compile new versions of the
;;  files, in case there have been any changes to Lisp macros (in
;;  `icicles-mac.el').

;; Inspired by Justine Tunney's disaster.el (http://github.com/jart/disaster\342\200\216).

;; iasm provides a simple interactive interface objdump and ldd which
;; facilitates assembly exploration. It also provides tools to speed up the
;; edit-compile-disasm loop.

;; This mode currently only supports Linux because it relies rather heavily on
;; objdump and ldd. It also hasn't been tested for other CPU architectures or
;; other unixes so expect some of the regexes to spaz out in colourful ways.

;; Note that this is my first foray into elisp so monstrosities abound. Go forth
;; at your own peril. If you wish to slay the beasts that lurk within or simply
;; add a few functionalities, contributions are more then welcome. See the todo
;; section for ideas.


;;; Installation:

;; Make sure to place `iasm-mode.el` somewhere in the load-path and add the
;; following lines to your `.emacs` to enable iasm:

;;     (require 'iasm-mode)

;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c C-d\") 'iasm-disasm)

;; This package converts the buffer text and the associated

;; features and additions.  All suggestions are more than welcome.

;; To use it, just switch to the buffer you want HTML-ized and type
;; `M-x htmlize-buffer'.  You will be switched to a new buffer that
;; contains the resulting HTML code.  You can edit and inspect this
;; buffer, or you can just save it with C-x C-w.  `M-x htmlize-file'
;; will find a file, fontify it, and save the HTML version in
;; FILE.html, without any additional intervention.  `M-x
;; htmlize-many-files' allows you to htmlize any number of files in
;; the same manner.  `M-x htmlize-many-files-dired' does the same for
;; files marked in a dired buffer.

;; htmlize supports three types of HTML output, selected by setting
;; `htmlize-output-type': `css', `inline-css', and `font'.  In `css'
;; mode, htmlize uses cascading style sheets to specify colors; it
;; generates classes that correspond to Emacs faces and uses <span
;; class=FACE>...</span> to color parts of text.  In this mode, the
;; produced HTML is valid under the 4.01 strict DTD, as confirmed by
;; the W3C validator.  `inline-css' is like `css', except the CSS is
;; put directly in the STYLE attribute of the SPAN element, making it
;; possible to paste the generated HTML into existing HTML documents.
;; In `font' mode, htmlize uses <font color=\"...\">...</font> to
;; colorize HTML, which is not standard-compliant, but works better in
;; older browsers.  `css' mode is the default.

;; You can also use htmlize from your Emacs Lisp code.  When called
;; non-interactively, `htmlize-buffer' and `htmlize-region' will
;; return the resulting HTML buffer, but will not change current
;; buffer or move the point.  htmlize will do its best to work on
;; non-windowing Emacs sessions but the result will be limited to
;; colors supported by the terminal.

;; htmlize aims for compatibility with Emacsen version 21 and later.
;; Please let me know if it doesn't work on the version of XEmacs or
;; GNU Emacs that you are using.  The package relies on the presence
;; of CL extensions, especially for cross-emacs compatibility; please
;; don't try to remove that dependency.  I see no practical problems
;; with using the full power of the CL extensions, except that one
;; might learn to like them too much.

;; The latest version is available as a git repository at:

;; ### HTML to Markdown converter written in Emacs-lisp. ###
;; 
;; This package defines two main functions: `html-to-markdown' and
;; `html-to-markdown-string'.
;; 
;; The functions are written entirely in Emacs-lisp (which means they'll
;; work on any platform with no external dependencies), and they convert
;; HTML source code into Markdown format. Of course, HTML has many more
;; features than Markdown, so any tags that can't be converted are left
;; as-is (or deleted, if the user so requests).
;; 
;; Instructions
;; ------
;; 
;; To use this package, simply install it from Melpa (M-x
;; `package-install' RET html-to-markdown) and the relevant functions will
;; be autoloaded.
;; 
;; - `html-to-markdown'  
;;   Is meant for interactive use. It takes the current buffer (or
;;   region), converts to Markdown, and displays the result in a separate
;;   window.
;; 
;; - `html-to-markdown-string'  
;;   Is meant for lisp code. It takes a string argument, which is
;;   converted to Markdown, and the result is returned.
;;   
;; Both of these functions take an extra boolean argument
;; `erase-unknown'. If it's non-nil, tags which can't be converted will
;; be erased.

;;  This library extends standard library `hl-line.el' in these ways:
;;
;;  1. As an alternative to turning on `hl-line' highlighting at all
;;     times, you can turn it on only when Emacs is idle.  To do that,
;;     use command `toggle-hl-line-when-idle' and customize
;;     `global-hl-line-mode' to nil.
;;
;;  2. As another alternative, you can turn it on for only a few
;;     seconds.  To do that, use command `flash-line-highlight' and
;;     customize `global-hl-line-mode' to nil.
;;
;;  3. It provides a face, `hl-line', that you can customize, instead
;;     of using option `hl-line-face'.
;;
;;     I suggested #3 to the Emacs developers, and it was added to
;;     Emacs 22, but with a different default value.  If you use
;;     library `crosshairs.el', you might want to customize this to a
;;     value similar to what is used there, so that the horizontal and
;;     vertical highlights will be the same.
;;
;;  4. Option `hl-line-overlay-priority' is provided, so that you can
;;     make hl-line highlighting appear on top of other overlay
;;     highlighting that might exist.
;;
;;  To use this library, put this in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'hl-line+) ; Load this file (it will load `hl-line.el')
;;
;;  To turn on `global-hl-line-mode' only when Emacs is idle, by
;;  default, add this line also to your init file:
;;
;;    (toggle-hl-line-when-idle 1) ; Highlight only when idle
;;
;;  You can use command `toggle-hl-line-when-idle' to turn idle
;;  highlighting on and off at any time.  You can use command
;;  `hl-line-when-idle-interval' to change the number of idle seconds
;;  to wait before highlighting.
;;
;;
;;  See also these libraries:
;;
;;  * `col-highlight.el', which highlights the current column.
;;
;;  * `crosshairs.el', which highlights the current line and the
;;    current column, at the same time.  It requires libraries
;;    `col-highlight.el' and `hl-line+.el'.
;;
;;  * `hl-spotlight.el', which extends `hl-line.el' by spotlighting
;;    the lines around the cursor.

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'hippie-namespace)
;;
;;     (global-hippie-namespace-mode 1)
;;
;;     (define-key global-map (kbd \"M-/\") 'hippie-expand)
;;
;;     hi [M-/]     ; The first one or two letters of a namespace
;;                  ; found in the current buffer, followed by the
;;                  ; key bound to `hippie-expand'.
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; The purpose of hippie-namespace is to save typing.
;;
;; Enabling this minor mode adds a limited number of very common
;; prefixes to the `hippie-expand' expansion list.  These prefixes
;; (deduced from buffer content) will be the first completions
;; considered.
;;
;; Furthermore, hippie-namespace completions are treated specially:
;; when `hippie-expand' proposes a namespace completion, it will not
;; cycle.  Instead, the namespace completion is implicitly accepted,
;; and further invocations of `hippie-expand' will build on the
;; expansion.
;;
;; For example, the common prefix of all symbols in this library is
;; \"hippie-namespace-\".  If, while editing this library, the user
;; types \"hi [hippie-expand]\" or even just \"h [hippie-expand]\",
;; the full prefix is expanded.
;;
;; \"hi [hippie-expand] [hippie-expand] ...\" will then cycle through
;; all completions which match the prefix.
;;
;; To use this library, install the file somewhere that Emacs can find
;; it and add the following to your ~/.emacs file
;;
;;     (require 'hippie-namespace)
;;     (global-hippie-namespace-mode 1)
;;
;; The minor mode will examine each buffer to guess namespace prefixes
;; dynamically.  If the guess is not good enough, you may add to the
;; list by executing
;;
;;     M-x hippie-namespace-add
;;
;; or by adding a file-local variable at the end of your file:
;;
;;     ;; Local Variables:
;;     ;; hippie-namespace-local-list: (namespace-1 namespace-2)
;;     ;; End:
;;
;; Note that you should also have `hippie-expand' bound to a key.
;; Many people override dabbrev expansion:
;;
;;     (define-key global-map (kbd \"M-/\") 'hippie-expand)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET hippie-namespace RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET hippie-expand RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This mode makes more sense for some languages and less sense for
;;     others.  In most languages, the declared \"namespace\" is
;;     infrequently used in its own context.  (For Emacs Lisp that is
;;     not the case.)
;;
;;     Some attempt is made to detect the import of external
;;     namespaces, and a textual analysis is done, but nothing fancy.
;;
;;     Integrates with `expand-region', adding an expansion which is
;;     aware of the namespace and non-namespace portions of a symbol.
;;
;;     Mode-specific namespace plugins are easy to write.  Search for
;;     \"Howto\" in the source.

;;   `hc-toggle-highlight-hard-hyphens').
;;
;; * Trailing whitespace: tabs, spaces, and hard spaces at the end of
;;   a line of text (command
;;   `hc-toggle-highlight-trailing-whitespace')
;;
;; * Any set of chars you choose (commands `hc-highlight-chars' and
;;   `hc-toggle-highlight-other-chars').  You can specify characters
;;   in four ways: (1) individually, (2) using ranges, (3) using
;;   character classes (e.g. [:digit:]), and (4) using character sets
;;   (e.g. `iso-8859-1' or `lao').
;;
;;   For `hc-toggle-highlight-other-chars', you can also specify
;;   characters (the same four ways) that are to be *excluded* from
;;   highlighting.
;;
;;   You can thus, for example, highlight all characters in character
;;   set `greek-iso8859-7' except `GREEK SMALL LETTER LAMBDA'.  Or all
;;   characters in class `[:space:]' (whitespace) except `tab'.  Or
;;   all Unicode characters in the range ?\\u2190 through ?\\u21ff
;;   (mathematical arrows) except ?\\u21b6, ?\\u21b7, ?\\u21ba, and
;;   ?\\u21bb (curved arrows).  You get the idea.
;;
;;   - Command `hc-highlight-chars' prompts you for the characters to
;;     highlight and the face to use.  With a prefix arg it
;;     unhighlights.
;;
;;   - Command `hc-toggle-highlight-other-chars' toggles highlighting,
;;     using face `hc-other-char', of the characters specified by user
;;     option `hc-other-chars', but excluding the characters specified
;;     by option `hc-other-chars-NOT'.  With a prefix arg it prompts
;;     you for the face to use.
;;
;;   For these particular commands and functions, option
;;   `hc-other-chars-font-lock-override' controls whether the current
;;   highlighting face overrides (`t'), is overridden by (`keep'), or
;;   merges with (`append' or `prepend') any existing highlighting.
;;
;; To use this library, add this to your init file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;      (require 'highlight-chars) ; Load this library.
;;
;; You can then use the commands and functions defined here to turn
;; the various kinds of highlighting on and off when in Font-Lock
;; mode.  For example, you can bind a key to toggle highlighting of
;; trailing whitespace:
;;
;;      (global-set-key (kbd \"<f11>\")
;;                      'hc-toggle-highlight-trailing-whitespace)
;;
;; Because variable `font-lock-keywords' is buffer-local, that key
;; binding lets you use `f11' to toggle highlighting separately in
;; each buffer.
;;
;; But if you want to use a particular kind of highlighting by default
;; globally, then just add the corresponding `hc-highlight-*' function
;; to the hook `font-lock-mode-hook'.  Then, whenever Font-Lock mode
;; is turned on (in any buffer), the appropriate highlighting will
;; also be turned on.
;;
;; For example, you can turn on tab highlighting everywhere by default
;; by adding function `hc-highlight-tabs' to `font-lock-mode-hook' in
;; your init file (`~/.emacs'), as follows:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook 'hc-highlight-tabs)
;;
;; In addition to buffer-specific highlighting and global
;; highlighting, you can turn on a given kind of highlighting
;; automatically for all buffers that are in a certain major mode.
;;
;; For that, do the following, where `THE-MODE' is the appropriate
;; mode symbol (value of variable `major-mode'), such as `text-mode'.
;; This example turns on trailing whitespace highlighting - use
;; different `hc-highlight-*' and `hc-dont-highlight-*' functions for
;; other kinds of highlighting.
;;
;;      (add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook
;;                (lambda ()
;;                  (add-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook
;;                            'hc-highlight-trailing-whitespace)))
;
;;      (add-hook 'after-change-major-mode-hook
;;                (lambda ()
;;                  (when (eq major-mode 'THE-MODE)
;;                    (remove-hook 'font-lock-mode-hook
;;                                 'hc-highlight-trailing-whitespace)
;;                    (hc-dont-highlight-trailing-whitespace)))
;;                'APPEND)
;;
;; Highlighting Different Sets of Characters in Different Buffers
;; --------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Especially for highlighting non-whitespace characters (commands
;; `hc-toggle-highlight-other-chars' and `hc-highlight-chars'), it can
;; sometimes be useful to highlight different characters in different
;; buffers.  For example, you might want to highlight all Chinese
;; characters in a Gnus buffer and all hexadecimal digits in a CSS or
;; HTML buffer.
;;
;; You can do this by setting the local value of option
;; `hc-other-chars' (and perhaps option `hc-other-chars-NOT') in each
;; of the buffers.  For example:
;;
;;      (with-current-buffer (current-buffer)
;;        (set (make-local-variable 'hc-other-chars)
;;             '(chinese-big5-1)))
;;
;; You can use Customize to find the Lisp value that corresponds to
;; the highlighting you want: `M-x customize-option hc-other-chars',
;; then use button `Value Menu' to choose a value, then button `State
;; to `Set for Current Session'.
;;
;; Then use `C-h v hc-other-chars' to see what the Lisp value is (for
;; example, `(chinese-big5-1)'), and plug that value into the
;; `make-local-variable' expression.
;;
;; Vanilla Emacs Highlighting of Hard Spaces and Hyphens
;; -----------------------------------------------------
;;
;; Vanilla Emacs can itself highlight hard spaces and hard hyphens,
;; and it does so whenever `nobreak-char-display' is non-nil, which it
;; is by default.  By \"hard\" space and hyphen I mean \"no-break\" or
;; non-breaking.  These are the non-ASCII Unicode characters with code
;; points 160 (#xa0) and 8209 (#x2011), respectively.
;;
;; This low-level vanilla Emacs highlighting does not use Font Lock
;; mode, and it cannot highlight only one of these characters and not
;; the other.
;;
;; Using `highlight-chars.el' to highlight hard space and hyphen chars
;; requires turning off their default highlighting provided by vanilla
;; Emacs, that is, setting `nobreak-char-display' to nil.  This is
;; done automatically by the functions defined here.  When you turn
;; off this font-lock highlighting, the vanilla Emacs highlighting is
;; automatically restored.
;;
;; That is, the value of variable `nobreak-char-display' is reset to
;; its original value when `highlight-chars.el' was loaded (`t' is the
;; default value, so if you didn't change it prior to loading
;; `highlight-chars.el' then t is restored).
;;
;; NOTE: If you byte-compile this file in an older version of Emacs
;; (prior to Emacs 23) then the code for highlighting hard hyphens and
;; hard spaces will not work, even in Emacs 23+.  If you use Emacs 23+
;; then you should either byte-compile it using Emacs 23+ or evaluate
;; the source code that defines functions that highlight such
;; characters.  (This is because older Emacs versions interpret
;; [\\u2011] as just [u2011], etc.)
;;
;;
;; See Also:
;;
;; * Library `highlight.el' for ways to highlight text more generally,
;;   not just specific characters.  It is available here:
;;   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/highlight.el     (code)
;;   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/HighlightLibrary (doc)
;;
;; * Standard library `whitespace.el' for other ways to highlight
;;   whitespace characters.
;;
;;   This does some things similar to what `highlight-chars.el' does,
;;   plus other, unrelated things.  As its name suggests, its effects
;;   are limited to whitespace characters.  It is also somewhat
;;   complicated to use (10 faces, 24 options!), and it seems to have
;;   more than a few bugs.
;;
;;   Besides being simpler, I think that `highlight-chars.el' has an
;;   advantage of letting you easily highlight ONLY particular
;;   whitespace characters.  `whitespace.el' apparently makes you pick
;;   whether to highlight spaces and hard spaces together, or not, for
;;   instance.
;;
;;   (As a workaround, With `whitespace.el' you can get the effect of
;;   highlighting only one of these kinds of space by customizing the
;;   face used to highlight the other one so that it is the same as
;;   the `default' face.  But that will interfere with other font-lock
;;   highlighting of that other character.  Maybe I'm missing
;;   something, this seems to me the only workaround.)

;; and other easily confused characters remains an important use case,
;; however.

;;  ** Library `facemenu+.el' Puts Highlight on the Menu **
;;
;;  If you load library `facemenu+.el' after you load library
;;  `highlight.el', then the commands defined here will also be
;;  available on a Highlight submenu in the Text Properties menus.
;;
;;(@* \"User Option `hlt-use-overlays-flag'\")
;;  ** User Option `hlt-use-overlays-flag'
;;
;;  You can highlight text in two ways using this library, depending
;;  on the value of user option `hlt-use-overlays-flag':
;;
;;   - non-nil means to highlight using overlays
;;   - nil means to highlight using text properties
;;
;;  Overlays are independent from the text itself.  They are not
;;  picked up when you copy and paste text.  By default, highlighting
;;  uses overlays.
;;
;;  Although highlighting recognizes only nil and non-nil values for
;;  `hlt-use-overlays-flag', other actions can have different
;;  behavior, depending on the non-nil value.  If it is `only' (the
;;  default value), then only overlay highlighting is affected.  If it
;;  is any other non-nil value, then both overlay highlighting and
;;  text-property highlighting are effected.  This is the case, for
;;  instance, for unhighlighting and for navigating among highlights.
;;
;;  For example, for unhighlighting, if `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is
;;  non-nil, then overlay highlighting is removed.  If it is not
;;  `only', then text-property highlighting is removed.  A value of
;;  nil thus removes both overlays and text properties.
;;
;;  Keep this sensitivity to the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' in
;;  mind.  For example, if you change the value after adding some
;;  highlighting, then that highlighting might not be removed by
;;  unhighlighting, unless you change the value back again.
;;
;;  You can toggle the value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag' at any time
;;  between nil and its previous non-nil value, using command
;;  `hlt-toggle-use-overlays-flag'.
;;
;;(@* \"Temporary or Permanent Highlighting\")
;; ** \"Temporary or Permanent Highlighting\" **
;;
;;  Generally, highlighting you add is temporary: it is not saved when
;;  you write your buffer to disk.  However, Emacs has a curious and
;;  unfamiliar feature called \"formatted\" or \"enriched\" text mode,
;;  which does record highlighting permanently.  See the Emacs manual,
;;  node `Requesting Formatted Text'.
;;
;;  To save highlighting permanently, do the following:
;;
;;  1. `M-x enriched-mode', to put your file buffer in minor mode
;;     `enriched-mode'.  You will see `Enriched' in the mode line.
;;
;;  2. Choose text-property highlighting, not overlay highlighting, by
;;     setting option `hlt-use-overlays-flag' to `nil'.  To do this
;;     using Customize, choose menu item `Highlight using text
;;     properties, not overlays'.
;;
;;  3. Choose the highlight face to use:
;;     `M-x hlt-choose-default-face'.
;;
;;  4. Highlight in any way provided by library `highlight.el'.  For
;;     example, use `hlt-highlighter' (personally, I bind it to `C-x
;;     mouse-2') to drag-highlight as if using a marker pen.
;;
;;  5. Save your file.
;;
;;     Note that, although highlighting in enriched-text mode modifies
;;     the buffer, it does not appear modified (check the beginning of
;;     the mode line), so if you make no other changes then using `C-x
;;     C-s' will not save your highlighting changes.  To remedy this,
;;     just do something besides highlighting - e.g., add a space and
;;     delete it - so that `C-x C-s' will save to disk.
;;
;;  When you reopen your file later, it will automatically be in
;;  enriched mode, and your highlighting will show.  However, be aware
;;  that font-locking interferes with enriched mode, so you will
;;  probably want to use it on files where you don't use font-locking.
;;
;;(@* \"Commands\")
;;  ** Commands **
;;
;;  You can use any face to highlight, and you can apply a mouse face
;;  instead of a face, if you like.  A mouse face shows up only when
;;  the mouse pointer is over it.
;;
;;  The main command to choose a face to use for highlighting (or for
;;  unhighlighting) is `hlt-choose-default-face'.  It reads a face
;;  name, with completion.
;;
;;  But you can alternatively choose a color name instead of a face
;;  name.  The completion candidates are annotated in buffer
;;  `*Completions*' with `Face' or `Color', to help you identify them.
;;
;;  If you choose a color instead of a face then an unnamed pseudo
;;  face is created and used.  It has the chosen color as background,
;;  and its foreground color is determined by the value of user option
;;  `hlt-auto-face-foreground'.  If that option is nil then
;;  highlighting does not change the existing foreground color.
;;  Otherwise, the option value is the foreground color used for
;;  highlighting.
;;
;;  Another way to choose the highlighting face is to use command
;;  `hlt-next-face' or `hlt-previous-face'.  These cycle among a
;;  smaller set of faces and background colors, the elements in the
;;  list value of option `hlt-auto-face-backgrounds'.  You can use a
;;  numeric prefix argument with these commands to choose any of the
;;  elements by its absolute position in the list.
;;
;;  Choosing the default highlighting face using
;;  `hlt-choose-default-face', `hlt-next-face', or `hlt-previous-face'
;;  affects the next highlighting or unhighlighting operation.  You
;;  can also choose to automatically cycle among the faces defined by
;;  `hlt-auto-face-backgrounds', with each (un)highlighting command
;;  using the next face in the list.  To choose this behavior,
;;  customize option `hlt-auto-faces-flag' to non-nil.
;;
;;  The commands with `region' in their name act on the text in the
;;  active region.  If the region is not active then they act on the
;;  text in the whole buffer.  The commands with `to-end' in their
;;  name act on the text from point to the end of the buffer.  See
;;  also (@* \"What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type\").
;;
;;  The commands you will use the most often are perhaps
;;  `hlt-highlight', `hlt-highlighter', `hlt-next-highlight', and
;;  `hlt-previous-highlight'.  You might also often use the various
;;  commands to hide and show highlighted text.
;;
;;  You can use command `hlt-highlight' to highlight or unhighlight
;;  the region, or to highlight or unhighlight a regexp throughout the
;;  region, depending on the prefix argument.  It combines the
;;  behaviors of commands `hlt-highlight-region',
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-region', `hlt-highlight-regexp-region', and
;;  `hlt-highlight-regexp-region'.  I suggest that you bind
;;  `hlt-highlight' to a key - I use `C-x C-y'.
;;
;;  Commands `hlt-highlight-regexp-to-end' and
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-regexp-to-end' highlight and unhighlight a regexp
;;  from point to the end of the buffer, respectively.
;;
;;  Command `hlt-highlighter' lets you highlight text by simply
;;  dragging the mouse, just as you would use a highlighter (marker).
;;  You can thus highlight text the same way that you drag the mouse
;;  to define the region.
;;
;;  Command `hlt-eraser' lets you delete highlighting by dragging the
;;  mouse.  However, its behavior is different for overlays and text
;;  properties, and it is perhaps different from you expect.  If
;;  option `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is not `only' then it removes
;;  text-property highlighting for *ALL* faces (not just highlighting
;;  faces).
;;
;;  A prefix arg for `hlt-highlighter' and `hlt-eraser' acts the same
;;  as for `hlt-next-face': it lets you choose the face to use.  It
;;  has no effect for `hlt-eraser' unless `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is
;;  `only', in which case it erases the Nth face in
;;  `hlt-auto-face-backgrounds', where N is the prefix arg.
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use various commands that
;;  highlight and unhighlight text that has certain text properties
;;  with given values.  You can use them to highlight all text in the
;;  region or buffer that has a given property value.  An example is
;;  highlighting all links (text with property `mouse-face').  These
;;  commands are:
;;
;;  `hlt-highlight-all-prop' - Highlight text that has a given
;;                             property with any (non-nil) value.
;;
;;  `hlt-highlight-property-with-value' - Highlight text that has a
;;                             given property with certain values.
;;
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-all-prop' - Unhighlight highlighted propertized
;;                             text.
;;
;;  `hlt-mouse-toggle-link-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight links on a mouse click.
;;
;;  `hlt-toggle-link-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight links.
;;
;;  `hlt-mouse-toggle-property-highlighting' - Alternately highlight
;;                             and unhighlight propertized text on a
;;                             mouse click.
;;
;;  `hlt-toggle-property-highlighting' - Alternately highlight and
;;                             unhighlight propertized text.
;;
;;  As always for library `highlight.el', this \"highlighting\" can use
;;  property `mouse-face' instead of `face'.  You could, for example,
;;  highlight, using `mouse-face', all text that has property `foo' -
;;  or that has property `face', for that matter.
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 21 or later, you can use commands
;;  `hlt-next-highlight' and `hlt-previous-highlight' to navigate
;;  among highlights of a given face.
;;
;;  You can unhighlight the region/buffer or a regexp in the
;;  region/buffer using command `hlt-unhighlight-region' or
;;  `hlt-unhighlight-regexp-region'.  If you use overlay highlighting
;;  then you can use command `hlt-unhighlight-region-for-face' to
;;  unhighlight the region/buffer for an individual highlighting face
;;  - other highlighting faces remain.
;;
;;  You can replace a highlighting face in the region/buffer by
;;  another, using command `hlt-replace-highlight-face'.  With a
;;  prefix argument, property `mouse-face' is used, not property
;;  `face'.
;;
;;(@* \"Copy and Yank (Paste) Text Properties\")
;;  ** Copy and Yank (Paste) Text Properties **
;;
;;  You can highlight or unhighlight text by simply copying existing
;;  highlighting (or lack of any highlighting) from anywhere in Emacs
;;  and yanking (pasting) it anywhere else.
;;
;;  Put differently, you can copy and yank a set of text properties.
;;  You can use these commands to copy and yank any text properties,
;;  not just `face' or `mouse-face'.
;;
;;  To copy the text properties at a given position, use command
;;  `hlt-copy-props'.  You can then use command `hlt-yank-props' to
;;  yank those properties to the active region anywhere.  If the set
;;  of properties that you copy is empty, then yanking means
;;  effectively removing all text properties.
;;
;;  User option `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' controls which text
;;  properties to copy and yank, by default.  The default value of the
;;  option includes only `face', which means that only property `face'
;;  is copied and pasted.  That is typically what you want, for
;;  highlighting purposes.  A value of `t' for
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' means use all properties.
;;
;;  You can further control which text properties are copied or yanked
;;  when you use the commands, by using a prefix argument.  A plain or
;;  non-negative prefix arg means copy or yank all available text
;;  properties.  A negative prefix arg (e.g. `C--') means you are
;;  prompted for which text properties to use, among those available.
;;
;;  For copying, the available properties are those among
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that are also present at the copy
;;  position.  For yanking, the available properties are those among
;;  `hlt-default-copy/yank-props' that have previously (last) been
;;  copied.
;;
;;(@* \"User Option `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag'\")
;;  ** User Option `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag' **
;;
;;  Library `highlight' generally acts only on faces that it controls,
;;  that is, faces that you have explicitly asked it to use for
;;  highlighting.  It sets the text property or overlay property
;;  `hlt-highlight' on such highlighted text, so that it can recognize
;;  which faces it has responsibility for.
;;
;;  Sometimes, you might want to hide and show text other than that
;;  controlled by library `highlight'.  Similarly, you might sometimes
;;  want to navigate among faces other than those used for
;;  highlighting.  You can control this using option
;;  `hlt-act-on-any-face-flag', which you can toggle at any time using
;;  command `hlt-toggle-act-on-any-face-flag'.
;;
;;(@* \"Hiding and Showing Text\")
;;  ** Hiding and Showing Text **
;;
;;  You can hide and show text that you have highlighted.  You will
;;  want to read the Emacs-Lisp manual (Elisp), section Invisible
;;  Text, to understand better what this entails.  In particular, you
;;  should understand that for library `highlight.el', hiding text
;;  means adding the symbol naming the face to be hidden to both:
;;
;;  1. a text or overlay `invisible' property, making the text or
;;     overlay susceptible to being hidden by buffer-local variable
;;     `buffer-invisibility-spec', and
;;
;;  2. the buffer's `buffer-invisibility-spec', so that it in fact
;;     becomes hidden.
;;
;;  After text has been hidden this way, and unless the highlighting
;;  has been removed completely by unhighlighting the text, the
;;  `invisible' property of that text keeps the names of the faces
;;  that have been applied to that text and hidden previously, even
;;  after you show that text again.  Showing a hidden face simply
;;  removes it from the `buffer-invisibility-spec'; it does not change
;;  any `invisible' properties.
;;
;;  For example, if you hide face `foo' at some buffer position:
;;
;;  1. The `invisible' property of the text or overlay at that
;;     position is updated to include `foo'.  If there are no other
;;     faces that have been applied to this text and then hidden, the
;;     `invisible' property is just `(foo)'.
;;
;;  2. `buffer-invisibility-spec' is also updated to include `foo'.
;;     This hides all text properties and overlay properties with
;;     `invisible' property `foo', throughout the buffer.  If there
;;     are no other invisible faces in the buffer, then
;;     `buffer-invisibility-spec' has value (foo).
;;
;;  If you then show face `foo' at that same buffer position, there is
;;  no change to the `invisible' property.  `buffer-invisibility-spec'
;;  is updated, by removing `foo': if it was (foo), it becomes ().
;;
;;  There are several commands for hiding and showing highlighted
;;  text.  The basic commands for hiding and showing are
;;  `hlt-hide-default-face' and `hlt-show-default-face', which you can
;;  use to hide and show the face last used for highlighting.  With a
;;  prefix argument, you are prompted for a different face to hide or
;;  show; it then becomes the default face for highlighting.  You can
;;  also change the default highlighting face at any time using
;;  command `hlt-choose-default-face'.
;;
;;(@* \"Hiding and Showing Text - Icicles Multi-Commands\")
;;  *** Hiding and Showing Text - Icicles Multi-Commands ***
;;
;;  The other hide and show commands depend on your also using
;;  Icicles, which is a set of libraries that offer enhanced
;;  completion.  Complete information about Icicles is here:
;;  `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles'.  You can obtain Icicles
;;  here: `http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Icicles_-_Libraries'.
;;
;;  The Icicles commands defined for `highlight.el' are the following:
;;
;;  `icicle-choose-faces', `icicle-choose-invisible-faces',
;;  `icicle-choose-visible-faces', `icicle-hide-faces',
;;  `icicle-hide-only-faces', `icicle-show-faces',
;;  `icicle-show-only-faces'.
;;
;;  These are all Icicles multi-commands, which means that they each
;;  let you choose multiple completion candidates or all candidates
;;  that match your current input (a regexp).  To use them you must
;;  also use Icicles.  You can use command `icicle-hide-faces' to hide
;;  any number of visible faces.  Any text is hidden that has that
;;  face as a text property or an overlay property, depending on the
;;  value of `hlt-use-overlays-flag'.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-show-faces' is the opposite of
;;  `icicle-hide-faces': it shows invisible text that has the faces
;;  you choose.  Neither `icicle-hide-faces' nor `icicle-show-faces'
;;  has any effect on other faces, besides those you choose to hide or
;;  show, respectively; they each do only one thing, hide or show.
;;
;;  Command `icicle-hide-only-faces' hides the faces you choose, and
;;  shows all other faces, and command `icicle-show-only-faces' does
;;  the opposite.  You can thus use these commands to specify exactly
;;  what faces should be invisible and visible.  Empty input means
;;  none: If you choose no faces to hide (that is, hit `RET' with an
;;  empty minibuffer), then all faces will be made visible; if you
;;  choose no faces to show, then all will be hidden.
;;
;;  Currently, face attributes for highlighting are combined when
;;  overlays overlap, but the same is not true for text properties.
;;  For example, if you highlight a word with face `foo', and then you
;;  highlight it with face `bar', only `bar' remains as the face for
;;  that word.  With overlays, the attributes of the two faces are
;;  composed.  When you hide or show faces, this behavior difference
;;  has an effect.
;;
;;  You can hide text using the commands in this library for any of
;;  the purposes that you might use invisible text in Emacs.  This
;;  gives you an easy, interactive way to control which sections of
;;  text are seen by search and other Emacs tools.  Use the regexp
;;  highlighting commands, for instance, to highlight text
;;  syntactically, and then hide that highlighted text.  Or use
;;  `hlt-highlighter' to sweep over text that you want to hide with
;;  the mouse.
;;
;;  Hiding and showing faces also provides a \"conditional text\"
;;  feature similar to that available in desktop publishing
;;  applications such as Adobe Framemaker.  Publishers often use such
;;  a feature to produce different output documents from the same
;;  source document (\"single sourcing\").  You can use this feature
;;  similarly, if you have an application (printing is one example)
;;  that is sensitive to whether text is visible or invisible.  One
;;  caveat: Emacs faces are not saved when you save your file.
;;
;;(@* \"What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type\")
;;  ** What Gets Highlighted: Region, Buffer, New Text You Type **
;;
;;  Most mention of the \"region\" in this commentary should really say
;;  \"active region or buffer\".  If the region is active and non-empty,
;;  then only the text in the region is targeted by the commands in
;;  this library.  This lets you easily control the scope of
;;  operations.
;;
;;  If the region is not active or it is empty, then:
;;
;;  - If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is nil and there is no prefix arg,
;;    then the face is applied to the next characters that you type.
;;
;;  - Otherwise, the face is applied to the entire buffer (or the
;;    current restriction, if the buffer is narrowed).
;;
;;(@* \"Interference by Font Lock\")
;;  ** Interference by Font Lock **
;;
;;  If you use Emacs 22 or later, then you can use this library in
;;  conjunction with library `font-lock+.el' (it is loaded
;;  automatically, if available).  That prevents font-locking from
;;  removing any highlighting face properties that you apply using the
;;  commands defined here.
;;
;;  Otherwise, when `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is nil, font-lock
;;  highlighting will interfere with the highlighting of this library.
;;  In most cases, you will be able to highlight text, but sooner or
;;  later font-lock will erase that highlighting when it refontifies
;;  the buffer.  If `hlt-use-overlays-flag' is non-nil, there is no
;;  such problem : font-lock has no effect on overlays.
;;
;;(@* \"Suggested Bindings\")
;;  ** Suggested Bindings **
;;
;;  Library `highlight.el' binds many of its commands to keys on the
;;  prefix key `C-x X'.  It also adds menu items to the `Region'
;;  submenu of the `Edit' menu-bar menu, if you have a `Region'
;;  submenu.  To obtain this menu, load library `menu-bar+.el'.
;;
;;  Library `highlight.el' makes no other key bindings.  Here are some
;;  additional, suggested bindings (`C-x C-y', `C-x mouse-2', `C-x
;;  S-mouse-2', `C-S-p', and `C-S-n', respectively):
;;
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map [(control ?y)]     'hlt-highlight)
;;   (define-key ctl-x-map [(down-mouse-2)]   'hlt-highlighter)

;;  ** To Do **
;;
;;  1. Add commands to show and hide boolean combinations of faces.
;;
;;  2. Faces are not accumulated as text properties.
;;     Highlighting with one face completely replaces the previous

"]) (hi2 . [(20130925 558) nil "indentation module for Haskell Mode" single ";;; Commentary:

;; This is a modified version of haskell-indentation-mode.  Currently
;; the semantic parser is not changed, but the UI of tab completion is
;; reworked.  Most notably:

;;  - DEL and C-d is not mapped: if you want to indent backwards, you can
;;    use S-TAB.  This means no random jumping on backspace anymore.
;;
;;  - TAB steps to the right as before, but when the end is reached, it
;;    starts going to the left instead of wrapping around.
;;
;;  - TAB stays inside the code, instead of going to the beginning of the
;;    line.  As in pyhton-mode and perl-mode.
;;
;;  - Region indentation common case is supported: TAB and S-TAB is simply
;;    moving the whole region to the left/right by 1-column.  Can be
;;    pressed repeatedly.
;;
;;  - The current indentations are shown as underscores in the current
;;    line.  So you have some visual indication on what's gonna happen.
;;    Also useful while hacking on the parser and want to see the results.
;;    Can be turned off by setting hi2-show-indentations to nil in your
;;    init file or calling hi2-disable-show-indentations from the buffer.
;;    If there are collisions with other overlay hacking modes
;;    (e.g. fill-column-indicator), try to turn off
;;    hi2-show-indentations-after-eol.
;;
;;  - The buffer is not changed when indentation is not changed (so there
;;    are no undo points created and no dirty flag in the buffer if
;;    pressing TAB had no effect).
;;
;;  - The code for all this is somewhat commented and cleaned.

;; There is ongoing development on making this better and I invite
;; everyone to participate (report bugs, fix issues, etc.):
;;   https://github.com/errge/hi2
;;
;; Once this is stable and better in every way than the default
;; haskell-indentation-mode, I'm happy to merge it with haskell-mode,
;; but until this is moving fast, I want to keep it separate.

;;; Installation:

;;  Functions to manipulate colors, including RGB hex strings.
;;
;;  This library provides functions for converting between RGB (red,

;;
;;  An RGB hex string, such as used as a frame `background-color'
;;  property, is a string of 1 + (3 * n) characters, the first of
;;  which is \"#\".  The other characters are hexadecimal digits, in
;;  three groups representing (from the left): red, green, and blue

;;     Subject: Automatic header creation and maintenance
;;     Date: Wed, 1 Nov 89 09:33 PST
;;
;;     Enclosed is code to automatically create and maintain file
;;     headers.  This code is cleaner and mush more easily customized
;;     than any of my previous header postings.
;;
;;     New in this release are customizations that allow headers to be
;;     created and maintained from the command line.  This is good for
;;     projects with some vi die-hards or when headers are being added
;;     in mass for the first time.
;;
;;     Example:
;;        cd $EMACS/lisp
;;        headers -make *.el
;;
;;     I have found file headers to be very valuable in project
;;     development.  I always know who has been where and how many
;;     times they were there.  Most often, I also know what they did.
;;     The update count and last modified date are very useful in
;;     determining the proper version of a file to use.  I have often
;;     thought that it would be easier to integrate patches from
;;     individuals to gnu tools such as gcc and g++ if I knew for
;;     certain what version of a particular file they were working
;;     from.  If all had headers, I would see the update count and
;;     date in the \"diff -c\" output and would be able to find or
;;     recreate the file to patch accordingly.
;;
;;     In this message are three files:
;;       header.el - Emacs header functions and instructions
;;       headers.1  - Man page for command line headers useage
;;       headers    - Shell script for command-line headers.
;;
;; Text by Lynn Slater, updated as needed:
;;
;;     Mode-specific headers:
;;     ---------------------
;;      Not all headers need look alike.  Suppose that you have a unix script mode
;;      and want it to have a shell specifier line that all other headers do not
;;      have.  To do this, Place the following line in a hook called when the
;;      mode is invoked or in the code that establishes the mode:
;;
;;         (add-hook 'make-header-hook 'header-shell nil t)

;;      The header building blocks are sensitive to the different comment
;;      characters in different modes.

;;     Mode specific update actions:
;;     ----------------------------
;;      Suppose something needs to be automatically maintained only in certain
;;      modes.  An example is the .TH macro in man pages.  You can create mode-
;;      specific update actions by placing code like the following in the
;;      mode creation function of the mode hook.
;;
;;        (register-file-header-action
;;          \"^\\.TH[ \\t]+[^\\\" \\t]+[ \\t]+[^\\\" \\t]+[ \\t]+\\\"\\\\([^\\\"]*\\\\)\\\"\"
;;         'update-last-modified-date-macro)
;;
;;     Define individual header elements.  These are the building blocks
;;     used to construct a site specific header.  You may add your own
;;     functions either in this file or in your `.emacs' file.  The
;;     variable `make-header-hook' specifies the functions that will
;;     actually be called.
;;
;; Note on change-control systems:
;;
;;  If you use `header2.el' in a change-control system, such as RCS,
;;  you might need to leave it checked out.  This is because any
;;  change-control keywords in the file will be expanded during
;;  check-in.  Normally, you will want those keywords to be inserted
;;  in file headers unexpanded.

"]) (header-button . [(20130110 851) nil "clickable buttons in header lines" single ";;; Commentary:

;;    Starting with 24.4 (24.3.50.1 as of 20121212) this library is
;;    no longer required; the changes have been merged into Emacs.

;; This package extends `button' by adding support for adding buttons to
;; the header line.  Since the header line is very limited compared to a
;; buffer most of the functionality provided by `button' is not available
;; for buttons in the header line.

;; While `button' provides the function `insert-button' (as well as
;; others) to insert a button into a buffer at point, something similar
;; can't be done here, due to the lack of point in header lines.

;; Instead use `header-button-format' like this:
;;
;; (setq header-line-format
;;       (concat \"Here's a button: \"
;;               (header-button-format \"Click me!\" :action 'my-action)))

;; Like with `button' you can create your own derived button types:
;;
;; (define-button-type 'my-header
;;   :supertype 'header
;;   :action 'my-action)
;;
;; (setq header-line-format
;;       (concat (header-button-format \"Click me!\" :action 'my-action) \" \"
;;               (header-button-format \"No me!\" :type 'my-header)))

;; The function associated with `:action' is called with the button plist
;; as only argument.  Do no use `plist-get' to extract a value from it.
;; Instead use `header-button-get' which will also extract values stored
;; in it's type.
;;
;; (defun my-action (button)
;;   (message \"This button labeled `%s' belongs to category `%s'\"
;;            (header-button-label button)

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'hardhat)
;;
;;     (global-hardhat-mode 1)
;;
;;     ;; now you are protected from editing:
;;     ;;
;;     ;;     .git/index
;;     ;;     ~/.emacs.d/elpa/hardhat-0.1.0/hardhat.el
;;     ;;     ~/.emacs~
;;     ;;
;;     ;; and many others
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; A recent unwholesome trend is for package managers to install files
;; in locations such as ~/.cabal/, ~/.rvm/, or ~/.emacs.d/elpa/.  It
;; is rarely meant for such files to be edited; doing so can cause
;; data loss in some circumstances.
;;
;; In addition, many user-writable files created in the course of
;; ordinary work should never be altered by a text editor, eg the
;; database stored in a .git directory.
;;
;; Hardhat.el provides an extra layer of protection in your work.  If
;; you visit a file which looks unsafe to edit, Emacs will make the
;; buffer read-only -- even when the underlying file is writable.
;;
;; The read-only protection can be turned off for a buffer by the
;; usual methods, or by toggling off buffer-local hardhat-mode via
;; the lighter menu or
;;
;;     M-x hardhat-mode RET
;;
;; If a buffer is not visiting a file, `hardhat-mode' has no effect.
;; If the visited file is not writable by the user, `hardhat-mode'
;; has no effect.
;;
;; To use hardhat, place the hardhat.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'hardhat)
;;     (global-hardhat-mode 1)
;;
;; To inquire as to why hardhat has set or unset protection in
;; a buffer, the following interactive command is provided
;;
;;     `hardhat-status'
;;
;; but not bound to any key.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET hardhat RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     `hardhat-mode' takes no action until the user attempts an
;;     interactive command in a buffer.  This is (out of an abundance
;;     of caution) for compatibility: an Emacs Lisp library may freely
;;     open and write to a file protected by `hardhat-mode', so long as
;;     it is done programatically.
;;
;;     For any of the options settable in customize, rules making
;;     buffers \"editable\" override rules making buffers \"protected\".
;;
;;     A Boolean file-local variable `hardhat-protect' is provided.
;;     When `hardhat-protect' is set to either t or nil, no other
;;     rules are consulted.
;;
;;     Regular-expression matches are case-insensitive.  A case-
;;     sensitive test can be implemented by adding custom function
;;     to eg `hardhat-buffer-protected-functions'.
;;

;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     More exceptions are certainly needed in `hardhat-fullpath-editable-regexps'
;;
;;     Because Emacs can wedge if `file-truename' is called on a
;;     remote file (eg when using TRAMP), some filename tests used in
;;     hardhat are not precisely equivalent between local and remote
;;     files.  You can change this behavior by setting
;;     `hardhat-use-unsafe-remote-truename' via customize.  A better
;;     solution is to set `find-file-visit-truename' globally.

;; ### Seamlessly edit an html file using markdown. ###
;; 
;; **H**TML **a**s **M**arkdown.
;; 
;; This package defines a major-mode, `ham-mode', which allows you to
;; edit HTML files exactly as if they were Markdown files. Activate it
;; while visiting an HTML file. The buffer will be converted to Markdown,
;; but the file will still be kept in HTML format behind the scenes. Each
;; time you save the Markdown buffer, the file will be updated with the
;; HTML.
;; 
;; **Why?** This is mainly designed to be used with web interfaces which
;; take HTML text (such as some email clients) but whose editors pale in
;; comparison to Emacs (obviously).
;; 
;; This major mode will allow you edit your email (or whatever else
;; you're writing) with the full power of `markdown-mode'. In fact, you
;; will usually be able to write richer structures then client's web
;; interface would normally allow you to (lists within lists, for
;; instance). Just check out <C-h> C-f markdown-mode RET< to> see the full
;; range of commands available for editing.
;; 
;; Instructions
;; ------
;; 
;; To use this package, simply:
;; 
;; 1. Install it from Melpa (M-x `package-install' RET ham-mode) and the
;; `ham-mode' command will be autoloaded.
;; 2. Activate it inside any HTML files you'd like to edit as Markdown.
;; You can manually invoke M-x `ham-mode', or add it to `auto-mode-alist'
;; so that it can load automatically.  
;; For instance, the following snippet will activate `ham-mode' in any
;; `.htm' file containing the word *email*.
;; 
;;         (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '(\".*email.*\\\\.html?\\\\'\" . ham-mode))

;; Overview:
;;
;; guide-key.el displays the available key bindings automatically and dynamically.
;; guide-key aims to be an alternative of one-key.el.
;;
;; Here are some features of this library.
;; - guide-key automatically pops up the keys following your favorite
;;   prefixes. Moreover, even if you change key bindings, guide-key follows the
;;   change dynamically.
;; - guide-key can highlight particular commands. This makes it easy to find a
;;   command you are looking for, and to learn its key binding.
;; - guide-key doesn't overwrite existing commands and key bindings, so there
;;   is no interference with `describe-key' and `describe-bindings'.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; I added guide-key to MELPA. You can install guide-key with package.el.
;; Because guide-key depends on popwin.el, popwin.el is also installed.
;;
;; If you don't have package.el, please download popwin.el and guide-key.el
;; directly from https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el and
;; https://github.com/kbkbkbkb1/guide-key, and then put them in your

;; You just add your favorite prefix keys to `guide-key/guide-key-sequence'
;; as below.
;;
;;   (require 'guide-key)
;;   (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '(\"C-x r\" \"C-x 4\"))
;;   (guide-key-mode 1) ; Enable guide-key-mode
;;
;; When you press these prefix keys, key bindings are automatically
;; popped up after a short delay (1 second by default).
;;
;; guide-key can highlight commands which match a specified regular expression.
;; Key bindings following \"C-x r\" are rectangle family and register family.
;; If you want to highlight only rectangle family commands, put this setting
;; in your init.el.
;;
;;   (setq guide-key/highlight-command-regexp \"rectangle\")
;;
;; This feature makes it easy to find commands and learn their key bindings. If
;; you want to highlight both rectangle family and register family, set an
;; adequate regular expression like this.
;;
;;   (setq guide-key/highlight-command-regexp \"rectangle\\\\|register\")
;;
;; Moreover, prefix commands are automatically highlighted.
;;
;; Depending on your level of emacs experience, you may want a shorter or
;; longer delay between pressing a key and the appearance of the guide
;; buffer.  This can be controlled by setting `guide-key/idle-delay':
;;
;;   (setq guide-key/idle-delay 0.1)
;;
;; The guide buffer is displayed only when you pause between keystrokes
;; for longer than this delay, so it will keep out of your way when you
;; are typing key sequences that you already know well.
;;
;; I've confirmed that guide-key works well in these environments.
;; - Emacs 24.2, Ubuntu 12.04 or Windows 7 64bit
;; - Emacs 23.3, Ubuntu 12.04 or Windows 7 64bit
;; - Emacs 22.3, Windows 7 64bit
;; - Emacs 24.3.1, OS X 10.9
;; If popwin works, I think guide-key will work as well. You can use
;; guide-key with Emacs working in terminal.
;;
;;
;; Advanced usage:
;;
;; It is bothering to add many prefixes to `guide-key/guide-key-sequence'.
;; `guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag' releases you from this problem.
;; If `guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag' is non-nil, guide-key checks a
;; input key sequence recursively. That is, if \"C-x 8 ^\" is an input key
;; sequence, guide-key checks whether `guide-key/guide-key-sequence' includes
;; \"C-x 8\" and \"C-x\".
;;
;; For example, if you configure as below,
;;
;;   (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '(\"C-x\"))
;;   (setq guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag t)
;;
;; the guide buffer is popped up when you input \"C-x r\", \"C-x 8\" and
;; any other prefixes following \"C-x\".
;;
;;
;; You can add extra settings in a particular mode. Please use
;; `guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence',
;; `guide-key/add-local-highlight-command-regexp' and the hook of
;; that mode.
;;
;;
;; This code is a example of org-mode.
;;
;;   (defun guide-key/my-hook-function-for-org-mode ()
;;     (guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence \"C-c\")
;;     (guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence \"C-c C-x\")
;;     (guide-key/add-local-highlight-command-regexp \"org-\"))
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'guide-key/my-hook-function-for-org-mode)
;;
;; In respect of `guide-key/guide-key-sequence', you can add mode specific key
;; sequences without `guide-key/add-local-guide-key-sequence'. For example,
;; configure as below.
;;
;;   (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence
;;         '(\"C-x r\" \"C-x 4\"
;;           (org-mode \"C-c C-x\")
;;           (outline-minor-mode \"C-c @\")))
;;
;; In this case, if the current major mode is `org-mode', guide key bindings
;; following \"C-c C-x\".  If `outline-minor-mode' is enabled, guide key bindings
;; following \"C-c @\".
;;
;;
;; `guide-key' can work with key-chord.el.  If you want to guide key bindings
;; following key chord, you need to execute
;; `guide-key/key-chord-hack-on'.  Then, add your favorite key chord to
;; `guide-key/guide-key-sequence' as below.
;;
;;   (key-chord-define global-map \"@4\" 'ctl-x-4-prefix)
;;
;;   (guide-key/key-chord-hack-on)
;;   (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '(\"<key-chord> @ 4\" \"<key-chord> 4 @\"))
;;
;; If =guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag= is non-nil, more simple.
;;
;;   (guide-key/key-chord-hack-on)
;;   (setq guide-key/recursive-key-sequence-flag t)
;;   (setq guide-key/guide-key-sequence '(\"<key-chord>\"))
;;
;; In this case, key bindings are popped up when you type any of key chords.
;;
;; This hack *may be dangerous* because it advices primitive functions;
;; `this-command-keys' and `this-command-keys-vector'.
;;
;;
;; Here are some functions and variables which control guide-key.
;; - `guide-key-mode':
;;   guide-key-mode is implemented as a minor mode.
;;   Excuting M-x guide-key-mode toggles whether guide-key is enabled or
;;   not.  Because guide-key-mode is a global minor mode, guide-key-mode is
;;   enabled in all buffers or disabled in all buffers.
;; - `guide-key/popup-window-position':
;;   This variable controls where a guide-key buffer is popped up. A value of
;;   this variable is one of `right', `bottom', `left', `top'. The default
;;   value is `right'.
;; - `guide-key/polling-time':
;;   This variable controls a polling time. The default value is 0.1 (in seconds).
;; - `guide-key/idle-delay':
;;   This variable controls the delay between starting a key sequence and
;;   popping up the guide buffer. The default value is 1.0 (in seconds),
;;   which means that guide-key will keep out of your way unless you hesitate
;;   in the middle of a key sequence .  Set this to 0.0 to revert to the old
;;   default behavior.
;; - `guide-key/text-scale-amount':
;;   This variable controls the size of text in guide buffer. The default
;;   value is 0 (it means default size in Emacs). If you want to enlarge
;;   text, set positive number. Otherwise, set negative number.
;;
;; Enjoy!

;; Invoking the function `google-translate-query-translate' queries the source
;; and target languages and text to translate, and shows a buffer with
;; available translations of the text.  Invoking the function
;; `google-translate-at-point' translates the word at point or the active
;; region.

;; Installation:

;; Assuming that the file `google-translate.el' is somewhere on the
;; load path, add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (require 'google-translate)
;;   (global-set-key \"\\C-ct\" 'google-translate-at-point)
;;   (global-set-key \"\\C-cT\" 'google-translate-query-translate)
;;
;; Change the key bindings to your liking.


;; Customization:

;; You can customize the following variables:
;;
;; - `google-translate-enable-ido-completion'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-source-language'
;;
;; - `google-translate-default-target-language'

;; If `google-translate-enable-ido-completion' is non-NIL, the input
;; will be read with ido-style completion.

;; If the variable `google-translate-default-source-language' is set
;; to a non-NIL value, the source language won't be queried and that
;; value will be used instead.  Analogously, if you set the variable
;; `google-translate-default-target-language' to some non-NIL value,
;; that value will be used without querying.

;; You can always override this behavior by supplying a `C-u' prefix
;; argument to the function `google-translate-query-translate'.

;; Here is an example.  Suppose that your native language is Russian
;; and you frequently need to translate from various languages to
;; Russian.  Then it is reasonable
;;
;; - to set the variable `google-translate-default-target-language'
;;   to \"ru\", and
;;
;; - to leave `google-translate-default-source-language' set to its
;;   default value, NIL.
;;
;; In this case, the function `google-translate-query-translate' is
;; only going to query the source language and text to translate.
;; If you need to translate to some language other than Russian, you
;; can override the default for the target language by supplying a
;; `C-u' prefix argument, in which case you will be queried for both
;; the source and target languages, as well as text to translate.

;; If you frequently translate from some fixed language, it is also
;; reasonable to set `google-translate-default-source-language' to
;; an appropriate value.
;;
;; If you have both the default source and target languages specified,
;; you may like to bind functions `google-translate-at-point-reverse'
;; and `google-translate-query-translate-reverse' to some keys, e.g.:
;;
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c r\") 'google-translate-at-point-reverse)
;;   (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c R\") 'google-translate-query-translate-reverse)
;;
;; This will allow you to quickly translate in the reverse direction.
;; When the default source (resp. target) language is not set, the
;; target (resp. source) language of the reverse translation will be
;; queried interactively.

;; The admitted values of `google-translate-default-source-language'
;; and `google-translate-default-target-language' are the codes of the
;; languages supported by Google Translate (like \"ru\" for Russian
;; above).  See `google-translate-supported-languages' for the list of
;; the supported languages, or customize the defaults using the
;; customization mechanism of Emacs.  Setting a default language to
;; NIL means that language will always be queried.  Moreover, the
;; variable `google-translate-default-source-language' can be set to a
;; special value \"auto\" that is interpreted as the instruction for
;; Google Translate to detect the source language.  This option is
;; also available when you are queried for the source language: simply
;; leave this parameter blank by pressing RET.  (If you have enabled
;; the ido-style completion, \"Detect language\" is going to be the
;; first option, which you can select simply by hitting RET.)
;;
;; The variable `google-translate-show-phonetic' controls whether the
;; phonetic spelling of the original text and its translation is
;; displayed if available.  If you want to see the phonetics, set this
;; variable to T.
;;
;; There are also three faces you can customize:
;;
;; - `google-translate-text-face', used to display the original text
;;   (defaults to `default')
;;
;; - `google-translate-phonetic-face', used to display the phonetics
;;   (defaults to `shadow')
;;
;; - `google-translate-translation-face', used to display the highest
;;   ranking translation (defaults to `default' with the `weight'
;;   attribute set to `bold')
;;
;; For example, to show the translation in a larger font change the
;; `height' attribute of the face `google-translate-translation-face'
;; like so:
;;
;;   (set-face-attribute 'google-translate-translation-face nil :height 1.4)

;; google-this is a package that provides a set of functions and
;; keybindings for launching google searches from within emacs.

;; The main function is `google-this' (bound to C-c / g). It does a
;; google search using the currently selected region, or the
;; expression under point. All functions are bound under \"C-c /\"
;; prefix, in order to comply with emacs' standards. If that's a
;; problem see `google-this-keybind'. To view all keybindings type \"C-c
;; / C-h\".
;;
;; If you don't like this keybind, just reassign the
;; `google-this-mode-submap' variable.
;; My personal preference is \"C-x g\":
;;
;;        (global-set-key (kbd \"C-x g\") 'google-this-mode-submap)
;;
;; Or, if you don't want google-this to overwrite the default (\"C-c /\")
;; key insert the following line BEFORE everything else (even before
;; the `require' command):
;;
;;        (setq google-this-keybind (kbd \"C-x g\"))
;;

;; To start a blank search, do `google-search' (C-c / RET). If you
;; want more control of what \"under point\" means for the `google-this'
;; command, there are the `google-word', `google-symbol',
;; `google-line' and `google-region' functions, bound as w, s, l and space,
;; respectively. They all do a search for what's under point.

;; If the `google-wrap-in-quotes' variable is t, than searches are
;; enclosed by double quotes (default is NOT). If a prefix argument is
;; given to any of the functions, invert the effect of
;; `google-wrap-in-quotes'.

;; There is also a `google-error' (C-c / e) function. It checks the
;; current error in the compilation buffer, tries to do some parsing
;; (to remove file name, line number, etc), and googles it. It's still
;; experimental, and has only really been tested with gcc error
;; reports.

;; Finally there's also a google-cpp-reference function (C-c / r).

;;
;;  gnus-alias provides a simple mechanism to switch Identities when
;;  using message-mode.  An Identity is one or more of the following
;;  elements:
;;
;;  o From - sets the From header (i.e. the sender)
;;  o Organization - sets the Organization header (a common, optional header)
;;  o Extra headers - a list of arbitrary header to set (e.g. X-Archive: no)
;;  o Body - adds text to the body of the message (just above the signature)
;;  o Signature - adds a signature to the message
;;
;;  All of this is also provided by the standard `gnus-posting-styles'
;;  (which see).  Whereas Posting Styles let you set these up
;;  initially, though, gnus-alias lets you change them on the fly
;;  easily, too (in this regard gnus-alias is much like gnus-pers,
;;  upon which it is based; see 'Credits' below).  With a simple
;;  command (`gnus-alias-select-identity') you can select & replace
;;  one Identity with another.
;;
;;  There are other significant differences between gnus-alias and
;;  Posting Styles, too.  gnus-alias has a much simpler interface/API
;;  for selecting an initial Identity automatically.  Posting Styles is
;;  much more flexible (especially in that you can build up an
;;  \"Identity\" piece by piece), but with that flexibility can come
;;  some complexity.

;;  Other advantages to using gnus-alias:
;;
;;  o the ability to switch Identities in a message buffer
;;  o can access original message to help determine Identity of the
;;    followup/reply message
;;  o can act on a forwarded message as if it were a message being
;;    replied to
;;  o can start a new message with a given Identity pre-selected
;;
;;  It is possible to use both Posting Styles and gnus-alias, with
;;  `gnus-posting-styles' setup occuring before gnus-alias selects an
;;  Identity.  That much co-ordination is beyond my attention span,
;;  though; I just use this package.
;;
;;  There may also be some overlap between this package and
;;  `message-alternative-emails' (which see), though I'm not exactly
;;  sure what that really does.

;;; Installation:
;;
;;  Put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path, then add one of the
;;  following to your ~/.emacs startup file.  You can load gnus-alias
;;  every time you start Emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'gnus-alias)
;;     (gnus-alias-init)
;;
;;  or you can load the package via autoload:
;;
;;     (autoload 'gnus-alias-determine-identity \"gnus-alias\" \"\" t)
;;     (add-hook 'message-setup-hook 'gnus-alias-determine-identity)
;;
;;  To add a directory to your load-path, use something like the following:
;;
;;      (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"/some/load/path\"))

;; Defines a major mode for editing gnuplot scripts.  I wanted to keep
;; it simpler than other modes -- just syntax hilighting, indentation,
;; and a command to plot the file.

;; Some of this code is adapted from a more full-featured version by
;; Bruce Ravel (available here http://xafs.org/BruceRavel/GnuplotMode;
;; CC license).

;; Thanks to everyone, including Christopher Gilbreth and Ralph M\303\266ritz,
;; for sending suggestions, improvements, and fixes.

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\") t)

;; Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
;; (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/gnuplot-mode.el\")

;;; Configuration:

;; If you installed this via `package.el', you should take advantage
;; of autoloading.  You can customize features using `defvar' and
;; `eval-after-load', as illustrated below:
;;
;; ;; specify the gnuplot executable (if other than \"gnuplot\")
;; (defvar gnuplot-program \"/sw/bin/gnuplot\")
;;
;; ;; set gnuplot arguments (if other than \"-persist\")
;; (defvar gnuplot-flags \"-persist -pointsize 2\")
;;
;; ;; if you want, add a mode hook.  e.g., the following turns on
;; ;; spell-checking for strings and comments and automatically cleans
;; ;; up whitespace on save.
;; (eval-after-load 'gnuplot-mode
;;   '(add-hook 'gnuplot-mode-hook
;;              (lambda ()
;;                (flyspell-prog-mode)
;;                (add-hook 'before-save-hook
;;                          'whitespace-cleanup nil t))))

;; If you installed this file manually, you probably don't want to
;; muck around with autoload commands.  Instead, add something like
;; the following to your .emacs:

;; (require 'gnuplot-mode)
;;
;; ;; specify the gnuplot executable (if other than \"gnuplot\")
;; (setq gnuplot-program \"/sw/bin/gnuplot\")
;;
;; ;; set gnuplot arguments (if other than \"-persist\")
;; (setq gnuplot-flags \"-persist -pointsize 2\")
;;
;; ;; if you want, add a mode hook.  e.g., the following turns on
;; ;; spell-checking for strings and comments and automatically cleans
;; ;; up whitespace on save.
;; (add-hook 'gnuplot-mode-hook

;;
;; This is a major mode for composing gnuplot scripts and displaying
;; their results using gnuplot.  It supports features of recent
;; Gnuplot versions (4.4 and up), but should also work fine with older
;; versions.
;;
;; This version of gnuplot-mode has been tested mostly on GNU Emacs 23
;; and 24, but should also work with older GNU Emacs versions back to
;; Emacs 21, and XEmacs 21.
;; 
;; This mode offers several tools to help you compose your scripts,
;; including font-lock syntax colorization, a syntax table appropriate
;; to gnuplot, key bindings, pull-down menus, indentation, keyword
;; completions and variable customization using the Custom package.
;; Once the script is composed, there are several function for sending
;; some or all of the script to gnuplot.  The interaction with the
;; gnuplot process is within a comint buffer.  Plots can optionally be
;; displayed within Emacs.
;;
;;    C-c C-l       send current line to gnuplot
;;    C-c C-v       send current line to gnuplot and move forward 1 line
;;    C-c C-r       send current region to gnuplot
;;    C-c C-b       send entire buffer to gnuplot
;;    C-c C-f       send a file to gnuplot
;;    C-c C-i       insert filename at point

;;   S-mouse-2      set arguments for command under mouse cursor
;;    C-c C-d       read the gnuplot info file
;;    C-c C-e       show-gnuplot-buffer
;;    C-c C-k       kill gnuplot process
;;    C-c C-u       submit a bug report about gnuplot-mode
;;    C-c C-z       customize gnuplot-mode
;; M-tab or M-ret   complete keyword before point
;;      ret         newline and indent
;;      tab         indent current line
;;    C-c M-i       toggle inline plot display in comint buffer
;;
;; With the exception of the commands for sending commands to Gnuplot,
;; most of the above commands also work in the Gnuplot comint buffer,
;; in addition to the following:
;;     M-C-p        plot the most recent script buffer line-by-line
;;     M-C-f        save the current script buffer and load that file
;;    C-c C-e       pop back to most recent script buffer
;;
;; These two functions are useful for starting up gnuplot-mode:
;;
;; M-x gnuplot-mode
;;         start gnuplot-mode in the current buffer
;;
;; M-x gnuplot-make-buffer
;;         open a new buffer (which is not visiting a file) and start
;;         gnuplot-mode in that buffer
;;
;; Gnuplot-mode now includes context-sensitive support for keyword
;; completion and, optionally, eldoc-mode help text.  See the
;; commentary in gnuplot-context.el for more information.  If you
;; don't find it useful, it can be turned off by customizing
;; `gnuplot-context-sensitive-mode'.

;;
;; A recent version of this file can be found at
;;   http://github.com/bruceravel/gnuplot-mode/
;;
;; To autoload gnuplot-mode on any file with gp extension, put this in
;; your .emacs file
;;   (autoload 'gnuplot-mode \"gnuplot\" \"gnuplot major mode\" t)
;;   (autoload 'gnuplot-make-buffer \"gnuplot\" \"open a buffer in gnuplot-mode\" t)
;;
;; Something like
;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (append '((\"\\\\.gp$\" . gnuplot-mode))
;;			           auto-mode-alist))
;; is useful for having files ending in .gp start up in gnuplot-mode.
;;
;; Something like
;;   (global-set-key [(f9)] 'gnuplot-make-buffer)
;; may be useful.  This binds f9 to the function that opens a scratch
;; buffer (i.e. one that is not visiting a file) in gnuplot-mode.
;; This is handy for your quick 'n' dirty plotting chores.
;;
;; To use the `gnuplot-info-lookup-symbol' function, the file
;; gnuplot.info MUST be installed somewhere that info can find it.
;; This means you must either:
;;   1.  Copy gnuplot.info to the normal info directory or
;;   2.  Make sure info can find gnuplot.info by putting this in your
;;       .emacs file:
;;         (setenv \"INFOPATH\"
;;	      (concat (getenv \"INFOPATH\") \":\"
;;                    (expand-file-name \"/path/to/file\")))
;;       where \"/path/to/file\" is the location of gnuplot.info
;;
;; This mode has been tested extensively with GNU Emacs 23 and 24, and
;; in a limited manner with GNU Emacs 22 and XEmacs 21.

;;
;; gmail-message-mode
;; ==========
;; 
;; **gmail-message-mode** is an emacs major-mode for editing gmail
;; messages using markdown syntax, it is meant for use with browser
;; plugins which allow you to edit text fields with external applications
;; (in this case, emacs). See [Plugins][] below for a list for each
;; browser.
;; 
;; **The problem:** Lately, gmail messages have been demanding html. That
;;   made it very hard to edit them outside your browser, because you had
;;   to edit html source code (for instance, linebreaks were ignored and
;;   you had to type `<br>' instead).
;;   
;; **gmail-message-mode to the rescue:** Simply activate this mode in
;;   gmail messages (See [Activation][]); the buffer is converted to
;;   markdown and you may edit at will, but the file is still saved as
;;   html behind the scenes so GMail won't know a thing! *See
;;   [ham-mode][1] to understand how this works.*
;;   
;; Activation
;; ----------
;; Make sure you install it:
;; 
;;     M-x package-install RET gmail-message-mode
;;     
;; And that's it!  
;; *(if you install manually, note that it depends on [ham-mode][1])*
;; 
;; This package will (using `auto-mode-alist') configure emacs to
;; activate `gmail-message-mode' whenever you're editing a file that
;; seems to be a gmail message. However, given the wide range of possible
;; plugins, it's hard to catch them all. You may have to add entries
;; manually to `auto-mode-alist', to make sure `gmail-message-mode' is
;; activated.

;;
;; Modifications from the 1.0 version of glsl-mode (jimhourihan):
;;  * Removed original optimized regexps for font-lock-keywords and
;;    replaced with keyword lists for easier maintenance
;;  * Added customization group and faces
;;  * Preprocessor faces
;;  * Updated to GLSL 4.3
;;  * Separate deprecated symbols
;;  * Made _ part of a word
;;  * man page lookup at opengl.org

;; This package provides the following features:
;;  * Syntax coloring (via font-lock) for grammar symbols and
;;    builtin functions and variables for up to GLSL version 4.3
;;  * Indentation for the current line (TAB) and selected region (C-M-\\).
;;  * Switching between file.vert and file.frag
;;    with S-lefttab (via ff-find-other-file)
;;  * interactive function glsl-find-man-page prompts for glsl built

;; gitty is a very small extension to `vc-mode' to make common git

;; is that you do most interaction with git using the command line or
;; magit, but some often-used commands are accessible easily.

;; C-x v b is the main new command. It prompts for an existing branch
;; with tab completion enabled and checks that out. If the entered
;; branch does not exist, it prompts if it should be created. This
;; makes switching between branches for quick feature branches much
;; easier than with `vc-mode'.

;; gitty also provides quick keys to stash save and stash pop in
;; the current repository, and to see the current `status'.

;; For more information, see the docstring for the command `gitty-mode`.

;; Note, though, that gitty does override some `vc-mode' keybindings

;; Purpose:
;;
;; To support completion for GHCi commands (like :load, :module, :set
;; etc.) in inferior-haskell buffers.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; To turn on GHCi commands completion in inferior-haskell buffers,
;; add this to .emacs:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'inferior-haskell-mode-hook 'turn-on-ghci-completion)
;;
;; Otherwise, call `turn-on-ghci-completion'.
;;
;; You may also want to set `ghci-completion-ghc-pkg-additional-args'
;; to the list of additional argument to supply to `ghc-pkg'.  For
;; example, this variable can be used to specify which database (user
;; or global) or which package config file to use.
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; * This package is developed for Emacs 24 and it probably only works
;;   with Emacs 24.  In particular, we rely on lexical bindings, which
;;   have been introduced in Emacs 24, and on `pcomplete', which is
;;   effectively broken in 23.2.
;;
;; * Only the following commands are supported: :add, :browse[!], :cd,
;;   :edit, :load, :module, :set, :unset, :show.  It would be nice to
;;   have shell completion for :!, for example.
;;
;; * The starred versions of the commands :add, :browse[!], :load, and
;;   :module are not supported, partly because I don't use them, and
;;   partly because, for example, :module offers completion only on
;;   the exposed modules in registered packages in both the global and
;;   user databases, and for these :module *<mod> is meaningless.
;;
;; * :set and :unset support only a subset of all GHC flags: language
;;   extensions, warnings, and debugging options.  Adding completion
;;   for other flags is trivial.  It would be nice, however, to be
;;   able to generate the list of all GHC flags programmatically.

;; If multiple matches are found, navigation mode is entered, the

;;; INTRODUCTION
;;

;; What's this?
;;
;; It is a minor mode for Emacs. It aims to tame Emacs' archaic
;; default keybindings and make them more accessible to novice users.
;; Although titled \"GEdit\" mode, users of every graphical application
;; ever written should find most of these keybindings familiar. GEdit
;; was simply chosen as the namesake since that is what I was
;; primarily using before I discovered Emacs.

;; Why don't you just use GEdit if you like it so much?
;;
;; Listen buddy, I don't like your attitude!
;;
;; Seriously though, once I had a taste of Elisp, I was totally hooked
;; on Emacs. I actually tried to reimplement some basic Emacs features
;; as Python plugins inside GEdit, but gave up when I discovered that
;; a 10-line whitespace-stripping elisp snippet required 100 lines of
;; Python code to implement in GEdit.
;;
;; So, if you are a vetern Emacs ninja, this mode may be of little
;; interest to you. But if you are just starting out and you find the
;; default keybindings intimidating, then I encourage you to give this
;; a try.

;;; USAGE
;;
;; gedit-mode is now hosted on MELPA! Type `M-x package-install
;; gedit-mode`, then add the following code to your init file:
;;
;;     (require 'gedit-mode)
;;     (global-gedit-mode)
;;
;; For the complete experience, you'll want sr-speedbar, shell-pop,
;; and tabbar packages. I've listed those as requirements above,
;; although the code I've written here is smart enough not to explode
;; if they're missing. I also personally recommend visual-regexp and
;; ace-jump-mode, although those have nothing to do with GEdit ;-)

;;; TODO
;;
;; At this point, I believe that I have defined a highly accurate
;; reproduction of all of GEdit's default keybindings, at least
;; according to GEdit's official documentation. If there is anything
;; missing here, it is likely undocumented, but please do let me know
;; about it.
;;
;; I still need:
;;
;; * to think up some sensible new bindings for all the stuff that
;;   I've clobbered here.
;;
;; * to clean up some of the sr-speedbar and shell-pop config code,
;;   particularly allowing those settings to be reverted when
;;   gedit-mode is disabled.

"]) (fuzzy-match . [(20131226 1850) nil "fuzzy matching" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; Purpose:
;;
;; Fuzzy-match is a package of functions to provide non-exact comparison
;; between strings.  Since I am no expert on such things, and certain criteria
;; for non-exact comparison had to be dropped for reasons of efficiency (e.g.,
;; transposition), and the non-exact nature of non-exact comparison, this
;; package may or may not provide what you want.
;;
;; Caveat:
;;
;; This is fuzzy software.  Use it at your own risk.
;;
;; The fuzzy-matcher deals with comparing strings.  For a programmer wishing to
;; use the fuzzy-match library, the front-end functions are likely to be
;; `FM-matchiness' (and corresponding `FM-closeness'), `FM-all-fuzzy-matches'
;; (and corresponding `FM-all-close-matches'), and `FM-fuzzy-sort'.  These can
;; be thought to mirror `string-match', `all-completions' and `sort'.
;;
;; The function `FM-matchiness' returns an integer which is the number of
;; matching characters from STRING1 in STRING2.  What denotes \"the number of
;; matching characters\" is arbitrary.
;;
;; The fuzziness between two strings, STRING1 and STRING2, is calculated by
;; finding the position in STRING2 of a prefix of STRING1.  The first character
;; of STRING1 is found in STRING2.  If we find it, we continue matching
;; successive characters from STRING1 at successive STRING2 positions.  When we
;; have found the longest prefix of STRING1 in STRING2, we decide whether it is
;; a match.  It is considered a match if the length of the prefix is greater or
;; equal to the offset of the beginning of the prefix of STRING1 in STRING2.
;; This means that \"food\" will match \"barfoo\" because \"foo\" (the prefix)
;; matches \"foo\" in \"barfoo\" with an offset and length of 3.  However, \"food\"
;; will not be considered to match \"barfu\", since the length is 1 while the
;; offset is 3.  The fuzz value of the match is the length of the prefix.  If
;; we find a match, we take the prefix off STRING1 and the string upto the end
;; of the match in STRING2.  If we do not find a match, we take off the first
;; character in STRING1.  Then we try and find the next prefix.
;;
;; So, to walk through an example:
;;
;; (FM-matchiness \"pigface\" \"pigsfly\"):
;;
;; STRING1              STRING2         MATCH LENGTH    OFFSET          FUZZ
;; pigface              pigsfly         3               0               3
;; face                 sfly            1               1               1
;; ace                  ly              0               0               0
;; ce                   ly              0               0               0
;; c                    ly              0               0               0
;;
;;      => 4
;;
;; (FM-matchiness \"begining-of-l\" \"beginning-of-l\"):
;;
;; STRING1              STRING2         MATCH LENGTH    OFFSET          FUZZ
;; begining-of-l        beginning-of-l  5               0               5
;; ing-of-l             ning-of-l       8               1               8
;;
;;      => 13
;;
;; Another function of interest is `FM-all-fuzzy-matches'.  This returns a list
;; of those strings that have the highest fuzzy match with a given string.
;; Those strings are sorted so that there is a preference for strings with the
;; same number of characters, and sharing the longest prefix with the given
;; string:
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches \"abc\" '(\"xxabcxx\" \"xabcxxx\" \"xabx\"))
;;      => (\"xabcxxx\" \"xxabcxx\")
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches \"point-mx\" (all-completions \"point\" obarray))
;;      => (\"point-max\" \"point-max-marker\")
;;
;; (FM-all-fuzzy-matches \"begining-of-l\" (all-completions \"begin\" obarray))
;;      => (\"beginning-of-line\")
;;
;; Corresponding to `FM-matchiness' and `FM-all-fuzzy-matches' are
;; `FM-closeness' and `FM-all-close-matches'.  They differ from the former
;; functions in that they take into account the difference in length between
;; the target string and candidate string:
;;
;; (FM-closeness \"begining-of-l\" \"beginning-of-l\")
;;      => 12
;;
;; Note from above that the matchiness is 13 and the difference in length of
;; the two strings is 1.
;;
;; (FM-all-close-matches \"point-mx\" (all-completions \"point\" obarray))
;;      => (\"point-max\")
;;
;; Note from above that although the matchiness is equal between the target
;; \"point-mx\" and the candidates \"point-max\" and \"point-max-marker\", the former
;; candidate has less of a difference in length from the target.
;;
;; Other functions that may be of use to package writers using this package are
;; `FM-map-fuzzy-matches' (and corresponding `FM-map-close-matches') and
;; `FM-max-matchiness' (and corresponding `FM-max-closeness').  The mapping
;; functions map matchiness or closeness to a list, while the max functions
;; return the maximum matchiness or closeness from a list.
;;
;; Also provided are some interface functions for user packages.  These
;; functions are `FM-offer-corrections' and `FM-list-candidates'.  To
;; demonstrate the usefulness of this package, `lisp-spell-symbol' (analogous
;; to `lisp-complete-symbol') is provided.  Without an arg, the command uses
;; `FM-all-close-matches' to find spelling corrections:
;;
;; (goto-char (point-mx M-x lisp-spell-symbol RET
;;      -| Replaced point-mx with point-max
;; (goto-char (point-max
;;
;; With a double prefix arg, the command uses `FM-all-fuzzy-matches' to find
;; spelling corrections:
;;
;; (goto-char (point-mx C-u C-u M-x lisp-spell-symbol RET
;;      -| Possible candidates are:
;;      -| point-max                       point-max-marker
;;
;; Any number of prefix args means that the user is prompted when replacing
;; with the single correction candidate.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this file where your Emacs can find it and byte compile it.
;;
;; To use, put in your package that uses these functions:
;;
;; (require 'fuzzy-match)
;;
;; To use the interactive package, put the following in your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;; (autoload 'lisp-spell-symbol \"fuzzy-match\"
;;   \"Perform spell checking on Lisp symbol preceding point.\" t)
;; (define-key esc-map \"#\" 'lisp-spell-symbol)
;;
;; This will define the key M-# (ESC #) to call `lisp-spell-symbol'.
;; For Emacs-19 users you can also add an entry to the \"ispell\" menu-bar:
;;
;; (define-key-after ispell-menu-map [ispell-symbol]
;;   '(\"Check Symbol\" . lisp-spell-symbol) 'ispell-word))
;;
;;
;;  If you like `fuzzy-match.el', you might also be interested in
;;  Icicles, which lets you use the same fuzzy matching for minibuffer
;;  input completion: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/Icicles.

;;   (require 'fringe-current-line)
;;
;; 3. Activate the mode.
;;
;; * To enable it only in certain buffer, run `M-x fringe-current-line-mode'.
;;   Run again and you can disable it.
;;
;; * To enable it globally, add the following into your init file:

;; ## Limitation
;;
;; The indicator is not shown if the cursor is at the end of the buffer and the last line is empty.

;;
;;
;;  Summary:
;;
;;    Load this library from your init file (~/.emacs or _emacs).
;;    Add the suggested key bindings (below) to  your init file.
;;    Use `M-up|down|left|right' to move frames around incrementally.
;;    Use `C-S-v', `M-S-v', `C-S-next', `C-S-prior' to move frames to screen edges.
;;    Use `C-M-up|down|left|right' to resize frames incrementally.
;;    Use `C-M-z' or `C-x C-z' to iconify/hide all frames.
;;    Use `C-M-z' in a lone frame to restore all frames.
;;    Use `C-mouse-1' in the minibuffer to restore all frames.
;;    Use `C-mouse-1' in Dired to mark/unmark a file.
;;    Use `C-mouse-3' on the mode line to remove window from frame.
;;    Use `tile-frames-horizontally', `-vertically' to tile frames.
;;    Use `C-x o' to select `other-window' or `other-frame'.
;;
;;  Commands to incrementally resize frames are `enlarge-frame' and
;;  `enlarge-frame-horizontally'.  Sarir Khamsi
;;  [sarir.khamsi@raytheon.com] originally wrote `enlarge-frame',
;;  which he called `sk-grow-frame'.
;;
;;  Note on saving changes made with the commands defined here:
;;
;;    Some of the commands defined here change frame properties.
;;    You can save any changes you have made, by using Customize.
;;    To visit a Customize buffer of all unsaved changes you have
;;    made, use command `customize-customized'.
;;
;;    Frame parameter changes, such as background color, can be saved
;;    for future use by all frames or all frames of a certain
;;    kind.  For that, you must change the frame parameters of the
;;    correponding frame-alist variable.
;;
;;    There is no single variable for saving changes to parameters of
;;    the current frame.  Instead, there are several different
;;    frame-alist variables, which you can use to define different
;;    kinds of frames.  These include: `default-frame-alist',
;;    `initial-frame-alist', and `special-display-frame-alist'.  The
;;    complete list of such frame alist variables is available using
;;    function `frame-alist-var-names', defined here.
;;
;;    Example: Suppose you change the background color of a frame and
;;    want to make that the default background color for new frames in
;;    the future.  You will need to update the value of variable
;;    `default-frame-alist' to use the `background-color' parameter
;;    setting of the changed frame.
;;
;;    You can easily copy one or all parameter values from any given
;;    frame to any frame alist (such as `default-frame-alist'), by
;;    using the commands `set-frame-alist-parameter-from-frame' and
;;    `set-all-frame-alist-parameters-from-frame'.  Those commands are
;;    defined here.
;;
;;  NOTE: If you also use library `fit-frame.el', and you are on MS
;;  Windows, then load that library before `frame-cmds.el'.  The
;;  commands `maximize-frame' and `restore-frame' defined here are
;;  more general and non-Windows-specific than the commands of the
;;  same name defined in `fit-frame.el'.

;;
;; CAUTION
;; =======
;; THIS LIBRARY IS VERY EXPERIMENTAL!!!
;;
;;
;; Overview
;; ========
;; This library is an extension of `shell-command'.
;;
;; What this library does are:
;;
;;   1. Search for a regexp(*1) from text in current buffer by
;;      external command(*2).
;;      
;;         (*1) You can write regexp with syntax of external
;;              command.
;;
;;         (*2) External commands written in Perl (v5.8 or later
;;              is required), Ruby (v1.9 or later is required), and
;;              JavaScript(node.js) are pre-defined in this file.
;;              To use regexp syntax of your choice, you can
;;              write your own external command.
;;
;;   2. Let us browse search results from an external command via
;;      Emacs user interface like `occur' and `isearch'.
;;
;;      Also let us apply results of the replacement operation by an
;;      external command via `query-replace' interface.
;;
;;
;; REQUIREMENTS
;; ============
;; By shell scripts defined in this file as default external commands,
;; perl (>= 5.8), ruby (>= 1.9) or node.js is required.
;;
;; Also features `cl', `menu-bar' and `re-builder' are required.
;;
;; For better multilingual support, Emacs (>= 21) may be required.
;;
;;
;; INSTALLING
;; ==========
;; To install this library, save this file to a directory in your
;; `load-path' (you can view the current `load-path' using \"C-h v
;; load-path <RET>\" within Emacs), then add the following lines to
;; your .emacs start up file:
;;
;;    (require 'foreign-regexp)
;;
;;    (custom-set-variables
;;     '(foreign-regexp/regexp-type 'perl) ;; Choose by your preference.
;;     '(reb-re-syntax 'foreign-regexp)) ;; Tell re-builder to use foreign regexp.
;;
;;
;; TERMINOLOGY
;; ===========
;; Technical terms appear in this document are as follows.
;;
;; FOREIGN REGEXP:
;;     A regular expression in syntax which is foreign to Emacs.
;;     Typically, it is not so much backslashy.
;;     By default, Regular expressions in syntax of `Perl', `Ruby' and
;;     `JavaScript' can be used as FOREIGN REGEXP with this library.
;;
;; EXTERNAL COMMAND:
;;     An external program that gives Emacs the ability to handle
;;     FOREIGN REGEXP.
;;     Commands written in `Perl', `Ruby' and `JavaScript' are pre-defined in
;;     this library.
;;
;;
;; USAGE EXAMPLE
;; =============
;;
;; [Example-1] Query Replace in manner of Perl.
;;
;;   STEP-1: Set regexp-type to Perl.
;;
;;        `M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> perl <RET>'
;;
;;        NOTE: Once you choose REGEXP-TYPE, Emacs will remember it
;;              until exit. You can also set and save REGEXP-TYPE for
;;              next Emacs session by setting value via customize.
;;              See \"COMMANDS(1)\" section in this document.
;;
;;   STEP-2: Run query replace 
;;
;;        `M-s M-% (\\d+)---(\\d+) <RET> ${1}456${2} <RET>'
;;
;;        This command replaces text in buffer:
;;
;;           123---789
;;
;;        with text:
;;
;;           123456789
;;
;;        Variables in replacement string are interpolated by Perl.
;;
;;
;; [Example-2] Query Replace in manner of Ruby.
;;
;;   STEP-1: Set regexp-type to Ruby.
;;
;;        `M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> ruby <RET>'
;;
;;   STEP-2: Run query replace 
;;
;;        `M-s M-% (\\d+)---(\\d+) <RET> #{$1}456#{$2} <RET>'
;;
;;        This command replaces text in buffer:
;;
;;           123---789
;;
;;        with text:
;;
;;           123456789
;;
;;        Variables in replacement string are interpolated by ruby
;;        as if it ware in the string inside of a block of \"gsub\"
;;        method.
;;
;;
;; [Example-3] Query Replace in manner of JavaScript.
;;
;;   STEP-1: Set regexp-type to JavaScript.
;;
;;        `M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> javascript <RET>'
;;
;;   STEP-2: Run query replace 
;;
;;        `M-s M-% (\\d+)---(\\d+) <RET> $1456$2 <RET>'
;;
;;        This command replaces text in buffer:
;;
;;           123---789
;;
;;        with text:
;;
;;           123456789
;;
;;        Variables in replacement string are interpolated
;;        as if they are in String.replace method.
;;
;;
;; COMMANDS(1): SETTING REGEXP-TYPE
;; ================================
;;
;;  `M-x foreign-regexp/regexp-type/set <RET> REGEXP-TYPE <RET>'
;;
;;      Set type of regexp syntax to REGEXP-TYPE.
;;      By default, three regexp-types `perl', `ruby' and
;;      `javascript' are provided.
;;
;;      You can also set REGEXP-TYPE via customization interface:
;;
;;      `M-x customize-apropos <RET> foreign-regexp/regexp-type <RET>'.
;;
;;
;; COMMANDS(2): SEARCH AND REPLACEMENT
;; ===================================
;;
;; NOTE: While editing a regular expression on the minibuffer prompt
;;       of `foreign-regexp' commands below, you can switch to another
;;       `foreign-regexp' command without losing current editing state.
;;
;; `M-s M-o REGEXP <RET>'
;; `M-x foreign-regexp/occur <RET> REGEXP <RET>'
;;
;;      Show all lines in the current buffer containing a match
;;      for foreign regexp REGEXP.
;;
;; `M-s M-% REGEXP <RET> REPLACEMENT <RET>'

;; COMMANDS(3): WORKING WITH SEARCH OPTIONS
;; ========================================
;; NOTE: The status of each search option will be displayed by an
;;       indicator which is put on the minibuffer prompt of each
;;       `foreign-regexp' command, or put on the mode-line of a
;;       buffer `*RE-Builder*'. The indicator will be displayed
;;       like these: `[isxe]' for Perl, `[imxe]' for Ruby and
;;       `[ie]' for JavaScript.
;;       
;; `M-s M-i'
;; `M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-case-fold <RET>'
;;
;;      Toggle search option `case-fold-search'.
;;
;; `M-s M-m'
;; `M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-dot-match <RET>'
;;
;;      Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/dot-match-a-newline-p'.
;;
;; `M-s M-x'
;; `M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-ext-regexp <RET>'
;;
;;      Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/use-extended-regexp-p'.
;;
;; `M-s M-e'
;; `M-x foreign-regexp/toggle-eval-replacement <RET>'
;;
;;      Toggle search option `foreign-regexp/toggle-eval-replacement'.
;;
;;      When this search option is on, the replacement string for
;;      a command `foreign-regexp/query-replace' will be evaluated
;;      as expression. For example, these commands:
;;
;;        For `Perl':
;;          `M-s M-% ^ <RET> no strict 'vars';sprintf('%05d: ', ++$LINE) <RET>'
;;
;;        For `Ruby':
;;          `M-s M-% ^ <RET> $LINE||=0;sprintf('%05d: ', $LINE+=1) <RET>'
;;
;;        For `JavaScript':
;;          `M-s M-% ^ <RET> function (m) {if(typeof(i)=='undefined'){i=0};return ('0000'+(++i)).substr(-5)+': '} <RET>'
;;          (Replacement will be evaluated as a function in
;;           `String.replace' method.)
;;
;;      put line number to beginning of each lines.
;;

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'font-utils)
;;
;;     (font-utils-exists-p \"Courier\")
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Font-utils is a collection of functions for working with fonts.
;; This library has no user-level interface; it is only useful
;; for programming in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; The following functions are provided, most of which deal with
;; font names rather than font objects:
;;
;;     `font-utils-exists-p'
;;     `font-utils-first-existing-font'
;;     `font-utils-is-qualified-variant'
;;     `font-utils-lenient-name-equal'
;;     `font-utils-list-names'
;;     `font-utils-name-from-xlfd'
;;     `font-utils-normalize-name'
;;     `font-utils-parse-name'
;;     `font-utils-read-name'
;;
;; The most generally useful of these is `font-utils-exists-p', which
;; tests whether a font matching the given name is currently available
;; for use.
;;
;; To use font-utils, place the font-utils.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'font-utils)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET font-utils RET
;;

;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no
;;
;;     Uses if present: persistent-soft.el (Recommended)
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Checking for font availability is slow on most systems.
;;     Workaround: where supported, font information will be cached
;;     to disk.  See customize for more.
;;
;;     font-utils-exists-p only supports two styles of font
;;     name.  This page
;;
;;         http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Fonts.html#Fonts
;;
;;     describes four styles of font name.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Possibly return a font object instead of font-info vector
;;     from font-utils-exists-p.
;;
;;     Test whether (find-font (font-spec :name \"Name\")) is faster
;;     than font-info.
;;
;;     font-utils-create-fuzzy-matches is not exhaustive enough

;;
;; Font-lock menus.  `font-menus.el', enhanced, & fixed for Emacs 24+.
;;
;; This is library `font-menus.el', by Francis J. Wright, modified so
;; that it continues to work with GNU Emacs 24 and later (as well as
;; older versions), and with minor enhancements.
;;
;; Enhancements:
;;
;; * Added group `font-lock-menus', and renamed everything to use
;;   package prefix `flm-'.
;;
;; * User option `flm-font-lock-menu-wrap': non-nil means wrap around
;;   when changing levels, instead of just raising an error.  This has
;;   no effect when the commands are called from a menu, but you can
;;   bind commands `flm-font-lock-fontify-more' and
;;   `flm-font-lock-fontify-less' to keys.
;;
;;   If the non-nil value is `off' (the default value) then font-lock
;;   mode is turned off (absolute minimum font-locking) when cycling
;;   wraps around.  Any other non-nil value means cycle only among
;;   font-lock states.  If the value is `off' then you can cycle
;;   on/off even if there is only one font-lock level.
;;
;; TO DO:
;;
;; * Be able to associate *names* with numerical levels, in a given mode.
;; * Be able to easily customize sets of keywords (probably hard to do).
;;

;;
;; This package is intended for use with GNU Emacs 20 and adds

;; font display.
;;
;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put this file somewhere where Emacs can find it (i.e. in one of the
;; directories in your `load-path' such as `site-lisp'), optionally
;; byte-compile it, and put this in your .emacs:

;; Extracted from font-lock.el for GNU Emacs 20.3 and

;;    Enhancements to standard library `font-lock.el'.
;;
;;  This library tells font lock to ignore any text that has the text
;;  property `font-lock-ignore'.  This means, in particular, that font
;;  lock will not erase or otherwise interfere with highlighting that
;;  you apply using library `highlight.el'.

;;          font-locking.  In particular, unfontifying a large buffer
;;          (e.g. turning off `font-lock-mode') will take noticeably
;;          longer.  Give it a try, and see if the slowdown annoys

;; Explanation
;;
;; Emacs' built-in `flyspell-mode' has performance issues on some

;;
;;     http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=2056
;;
;; This package reduces the amount of work done by flyspell.  Instead
;; of checking *instantly* as you type, spelling will be checked when
;; Emacs has been idle for a short time.  (Vanilla `flyspell-mode'
;; does not use idle timers but a subtle combination of hooks and
;; `sit-for'.)
;;
;; This package also forces `flyspell-mode' off completely for certain
;; buffers.
;;
;; To use this library, add the following to your ~/.emacs
;;
;;     (require 'flyspell-lazy)
;;     (flyspell-lazy-mode 1)
;;
;; Then use `flyspell-mode' as you normally would.  This package does
;; not load flyspell for you.
;;
;; `flyspell-lazy-mode' will invoke spellcheck less frequently than
;; vanilla `flyspell-mode', though this can be changed somewhat via
;; `customize'.

;; Bugs
;;
;;     The longer the delay before checking, the more inaccurate the
;;     coordinates in `flyspell-changes'.  These are static integers;
;;     they don't move with updates in the buffer.  To mitigate this
;;     effect, a second idle timer checks all visible text (at a much
;;     longer interval).
;;
;;     Flyspell-lazy-matches-last-text is not reliable - in debug mode
;;     it can be seen that it sometimes toggles between two states at
;;     every press of spacebar.  This may be related to generating the
;;     additional span around the point.
;;
;;     Flyspell-lazy-refine-changes is sometimes mistakenly scrubbing
;;     all pending spans.  Check the case where one char is deleted
;;     inside a word.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Let flyspell-issue-message-flag and flyspell-issue-welcome-flag
;;     to nil wherever needed to improve performance.
;;
;;     Consider using while-no-input macro.
;;
;;     Figure out if flyspell-lazy affects suggestions -- must an
;;     update be forced on the word before running suggestions?
;;
;;     Force re-check of text after removing comments renders the
;;     text code again under flyspell-prog-mode.
;;
;;     Optionally add aspell extra args noted in doc.
;;
;;     Make flyspell-lazy-single-ispell actually work.  Currently, see
;;     a new \"starting ispell\" message for every buffer opened, in
;;     spite of flyspell-lazy-single-ispell setting.  This comes from
;;     flyspell-mode calling flyspell-mode-on.
;;
;;     What would be the ramifications of using a single ispell
;;     process?  Only loss of per-buffer dictionaries?
;;
;;     Enforce using a single ispell process on regions larger than
;;     flyspell-large-region.
;;
;;     Strip symbols from text - see flyspell-lazy-strip-symbols.
;;
;;     Heuristic to detect regular expressions and avoid checking
;;     them as strings.
;;
;;     Use buffer-undo-list instead of flyspell-changes, then can
;;     also remove flyspell's after-change hook.
;;
;;     Use the hints set in prog-mode to avoid checks in the per-word
;;     and refine stages.

;; $ apt-get install nodejs # or your distro / OS equivalent
;; $ sudo npm install -g jshint

;; You will probably want to configure the warnings that JSHint

;; { \"browser\": true, //browser constants, such as alert

;;   \"strict\": true // require \"use strict\";
;; }

;; Save this in a file called whatever.json and then set

;;; Usage

;; Add to your Emacs config:

;; (require 'flymake-jshint)
;; (add-hook 'js-mode-hook 'flymake-jshint-load)

;; making sure that flymake-jshint.el is on your load-path.  If not,

;; and you will see what is going wrong listed in the *Messages*

;; * https://github.com/lunaryorn/flycheck supports JSHint

;; This was inspired by and based on Tomohiro Matsuyama's fuzzy.el.

;; This file defines a minor mode that allows flex matching in
;; isearch-mode.  The flex matching is very similar to the flex
;; matching in ido mode (see `ido-enable-flex-matching').  Given an
;; isearch string, it is transformed to a regexp that matches the
;; original and also similar strings (basically, strings that contain
;; the original characters in the same order, but possibly with other
;; characters in between).  You can redefine
;; `flex-isearch-compile-regexp' to change this behavior.

;; When `flex-isearch-mode' is enabled, the `flex-isearch-auto'
;; variable controls when the flex matching is activated.  See its
;; docstring for details.  Also, `isearch-forward' and
;; `isearch-backward' are advised so that double prefix args (C-u C-u
;; C-s) will use flex search.

;; Le Wang has improved this by providing a better
;; `flex-isearch-compile-regexp' and the advice on
;; `isearch-toggle-regexp'.

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'fixmee)
;;
;;     (global-fixmee-mode 1)
;;
;;     right-click on the word \"fixme\" in a comment
;;
;;     ;; for `next-error' support
;;     M-x fixmee-view-listing RET
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Fixmee-mode tracks \"fixme\" notices in code comments, highlights
;; them, ranks them by urgency, and lets you navigate to them quickly.
;;
;; A distinguishing feature of this library is that it tracks the
;; urgency of each notice, allowing the user to jump directly to
;; the most important problems.
;;
;; Urgency of \"fixme\" notices is indicated by repetitions of the final
;; character.  For example, one might write \"FIXMEEEEEEEEE\" for an
;; important issue.  The `fixmee-goto-nextmost-urgent' command will
;; navigate to the longest notice first.
;;
;; To use fixmee-mode, add the following to your ~/.emacs
;;
;;     (require 'fixmee)
;;     (global-fixmee-mode 1)
;;
;; Then, open some buffers and right-click on the word \"fixme\" in a
;; comment
;;
;; or press
;;
;;     C-c f
;;
;; or
;;
;;     M-x fixmee RET
;;
;; or
;;
;;    roll the mouse wheel when hovering over the text \"fixm\"
;;    in the modeline.
;;
;; or
;;
;;    execute `fixmee-view-listing' to navigate using
;;    `next-error' conventions.
;;
;; Key Bindings
;;
;; The default key bindings are
;;
;;     C-c f   `fixmee-goto-nextmost-urgent'
;;     C-c F   `fixmee-goto-prevmost-urgent'
;;     C-c v   `fixmee-view-listing'
;;     M-n     `fixmee-goto-next-by-position'      ; only when the point is
;;     M-p     `fixmee-goto-previous-by-position'  ; inside a \"fixme\" notice
;;
;; To constrain the nextmost/prevmost-urgent commands to the current
;; buffer only, use a universal prefix argument, eg
;;
;;     C-u C-c f
;;
;; When the smartrep package is installed, the \"C-c\" prefix need not
;; be used for consecutive fixmee-mode keyboard commands.  Instead,
;; just keep pressing \"f\" (or whichever key you set in customize).
;;
;; There is also a context menu and mouse-wheel bindings on the
;; minor-mode lighter in the modeline:
;;
;;             mouse-1  context menu
;;       wheel-down/up  next/prev by urgency
;;     M-wheel-down/up  next/prev by position
;;
;; Patterns
;;
;; The following fixme patterns are supported by default:
;;
;;     @@@
;;     XXX             ; only this one is case-sensitive
;;     todo
;;     fixme
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET fixmee RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET nav-flash RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     Currently, only open buffers are searched, not files or
;;     projects.

;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     fixmee--listview-mode-map (the major-mode menu) does not work
;;     well as a context menu.
;;         - menu from major mode of selected window appears even when
;;           right-clicking in this window
;;         - mouse-event wrappers keep keyboard shortcuts from appearing
;;           in menu-bar
;;         - better to have a separate context menu attached to the
;;           entries, using a keymap text property
;;
;;     When comment-start is defined, only the first notice on a line
;;     is lit up by button-lock, though fixmee-mode is aware of multiple
;;     notices on a line.  This is worked around for the moment by
;;     stripping these cases from fixmee-notice-list.  Better would be
;;     to add comment-sensitivity logic to button-lock, and remove the
;;     comment-matching section of the regexp passed to button-lock.
;;
;;     Fixmee-maybe-turn-on gets called multiple times when a file
;;     is loaded.
;;
;;     Fixmee-buffer-include-functions may not contain the function
;;     'frame-bufs-associated-p, because a new buffer is not yet
;;     associated with the frame at the time the global mode check
;;     calls fixmee-maybe-turn-on.
;;
;;     Bug in tabulated-list: position of point is not maintained
;;     when sort headers are clicked while a different window is
;;     selected.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Push mark for navigation which happens from the listview
;;
;;     There is no need for fixmee--listview-mode to be an interactive
;;     command.
;;
;;     Consider allowing all navigation commands to update the listview
;;     buffer (currently only next-error commands do so)
;;
;;     Display fully fontified context lines in listview buffer - some
;;     lines have fontification, seemingly at random.  Disabling
;;     whitespace trimming and excluded properties had no effect.
;;
;;     Multi-line context in listview buffer - tabulated-list accepts
;;     newlines, but data then runs out of the column on the next
;;     line.  Would need to pad to match column position.
;;
;;     Better feedback messages for end-of-list and start-of-list.
;;
;;     Bookmark integration? (implicit bookmarking on notices).
;;
;;     Wrap/cycle options on navigation-by-position.
;;
;;     How to get last-command when user does M-x? (smex is not helping
;;     here).  (nth 0 command-history) ?
;;
;;     Navigation can land on line near vertical edge of window -
;;     should respect user settings and scroll in as needed for
;;     context.
;;
;;     Project support.
;;
;;     Some kind of extra comment indicating a notice is to be ignored?
;;     Lead with a backwhack?

;;
;;    Resize a frame.  In particular, fit a frame to its buffers.
;;
;;  Commands and user options (variables) are provided here to resize
;;  (shrink-wrap) a frame to fit its displayed buffers, its selected
;;  buffer, or the `fill-column' width.
;;
;;  The command to fit a frame is `fit-frame'.  The main user options
;;  for this command are `fit-frame-inhibit-fitting-flag' and
;;  `fit-frame-max-*[-percent]'.  You can use a prefix argument to
;;  control the behavior of command `fit-frame'.
;;
;;  To take full advantage of the functionality provided here, load
;;  the companion library `autofit-frame.el', to modify primitives
;;  `display-buffer' and `switch-to-buffer' so they automatically fit
;;  all frames that have a single window.  Library `autofit-frame.el'
;;  loads library `fit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (`~/.emacs'):
;;
;;    (require 'fit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer.  Even if you load library `autofit-frame.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer' are not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  Command `fit-frame' does *not* take the following into account,
;;  when determining the proper frame size:
;;
;;   - font sizes, other than the default frame font
;;   - characters that have special widths
;;
;;  NOTE: If you also use library `frame-cmds.el', and you are on MS
;;  Windows, then load that library after `fit-frame.el'.  This is
;;  because the commands `maximize-frame' and `restore-frame' defined
;;  there are more general and non-Windows-specific.

;;
;;  TO DO:
;;
;;  Emacs needs a command similar to `fit-frame' for windows, that is,
;;  a command that will fit the existing windows of a frame to their

;; This code contains a command, called `findr', which allows you to
;; search for a file breadth-first.  This works on UNIX, Windows, and
;; over the network, using efs and ange-ftp. It's pretty quick, and (at
;; times) is a better and easier alternative to other mechanisms of
;; finding nested files, when you've forgotten where they are.

;; You pass `findr' a regexp, which must match the file you're looking
;; for, and a directory, and then it just does its thing:

;; M-x findr <ENTER> ^my-lib.p[lm]$ <ENTER> c:/ <ENTER>

;; If called interactively, findr will prompt the user for opening the
;; found file(s).  Regardless, it will continue to search, until
;; either the search is complete or the user quits the search.
;; Regardless of the exit (natural or user-invoked), a findr will
;; return a list of found matches.

;; Two other entrypoints let you to act on regexps within the files:
;; `findr-search' to search
;; `findr-query-replace' to replace


;;; Installation:

;; (autoload 'findr \"findr\" \"Find file name.\" t)
;; (define-key global-map [(meta control S)] 'findr)

;; (autoload 'findr-search \"findr\" \"Find text in files.\" t)

;; (autoload 'findr-query-replace \"findr\" \"Replace text in files.\" t)
;; (define-key global-map [(meta control r)] 'findr-query-replace)


;; Change Log:

;; 0.1: Added prompt to open file, if uses so chooses, following
;;      request and code example from Thomas Plass.
;; 0.2: Made `findr' not stop after the first match, based on the
;;      request by Thomas Plass.
;;      Also, fixed a minor bug where findr was finding additional
;;      files that were not correct matches, based on
;;      `file-relative-name' misuse (I had to add the 2nd arg to it).
;; 0.3: Added a `sit-for' for redisplay reasons.
;;      Modifications as suggested by RMS: e.g. docstring.
;; 0.4  Added `findr-query-replace', courtesy of Dan Nelsen.
;; 0.5  Fixed spelling and minor bug in `findr-query-replace' when
;;      non-byte-compiled.
;; 0.6  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=cxjhfml4b2c.fsf_-_%40acs5.bu.edu :
;; From: David Bakhash (cadet@bu.edu)
;; Subject: Re: latest version of findr.el (5)
;; Date: 1999/07/31
;; Courtesy of Dan Nelsen, this version has search-and-replace capabilities.
;; it's still a bit experimental, so I wouldn't expect too much of it.  But it
;; hasn't been tested yet for friendly behavior.
;;
;; The function `findr-query-replace' wasn't working unless you byte-compile the
;; file.  But, since findr is really designed for speed, that's not a bad thing
;; (i.e. it forces you to byte-compile it).  It's as simple as:
;;
;; M-x byte-compile-file <ENTER> /path/to/findr.el <ENTER>
;;
;; anyhow, I think it should work now.

;; This file provides methods that quickly get you to your destination inside
;; your current project, leveraging the power of git if you are using it to
;; store your code.

;; A project is defined as a directory which meets one of these conditions in
;; the following order:
;;
;; - The presence of a `.dir-locals.el' file (emacs23 style) or a
;;   `.emacs-project' file (`project-local-variables' style).
;; - The git repository that the current buffer is in.
;; - The mercurial repository the current buffer is in.
;; - The project root defined in `project-root.el', a library not included with
;;   GNU Emacs.
;; - The current default-directory if none of the above is found.

;; When we're in a git repository, we use git-ls-files and git-grep to speed up
;; our searching. Otherwise, we fallback on find statements. As a special
;; optimization, we prune \".svn\" and \".hg\" directories whenever we find.

;; ftf provides three main user functions:
;;
;; - `ftf-find-file' which does a filename search. It has been tested on large
;;   projects; it takes slightly less than a second from command invocation to
;;   prompt on the Chromium source tree 9,183 files as of the time of
;;   this writing).
;;
;;   It uses git-ls-files for speed when available (such as the Chromium tree),
;;   and falls back on a find statement at the project root/default-directory
;;   when git is unavailable.
;;
;; - `ftf-grepsource' which greps all the files for the escaped pattern passed
;;   in at the prompt.
;;
;;   It uses git-grep for speed when available (such as the Chromium tree),
;;   and falls back on a find|xargs grep statement when not.
;;
;; - The `with-ftf-project-root' macro, which locally changes
;;   `default-directory' to what find-things-fast thinks is the project
;;   root. Two trivial example functions, `ftf-gdb' and `ftf-compile' are
;;   provided which show it off.

;; By default, it looks only for files whose names match `ftf-filetypes'. The
;; defaults were chosen specifically for C++/Chromium development, but people
;; will probably want to override this so we provide a helper function you can
;; use in your mode hook, `ftf-add-filetypes'. Example:
;;
;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
;;           (lambda (ftf-add-filetypes '(\"*.el\" \"*.elisp\"))))

;; If `ido-mode' is enabled, the menu will use `ido-completing-read'
;; instead of `completing-read'.

;; This file was based on the `find-file-in-project.el' by Phil Hagelberg and
;; Doug Alcorn which can be found on the EmacsWiki. Obviously, the scope has
;; greatly expanded.

;; Recommended binding:

;; This library provides a couple methods for quickly finding any file

;; You can set `ffip-project-root-function' to provide an alternate

;; If you have so many files that it becomes unwieldy, you can set
;; `ffip-find-options' to a string which will be passed to the `find'
;; invocation in order to exclude irrelevant subdirectories.  For
;; instance, in a Ruby on Rails project, you may be interested in all
;; .rb files that don't exist in the \"vendor\" directory.  In that case
;; you could set `ffip-find-options' to \"-not -regex \\\".*vendor.*\\\"\".

"]) (fill-column-indicator . [(20130807 619) nil "Graphically indicate the fill column" tar ";;; Commentary:

;; Many modern editors and IDEs can graphically indicate the location of the
;; fill column by drawing a thin line (in design parlance, a `rule') down the
;; length of the editing window.  Fill-column-indicator implements this
;; facility in Emacs.

;; PLEASE NOTE: There is a small incompatibility between this package and the
;; current stable Emacs relase (v24.3).  A bug in Emacs's internal display
;; routine that was introduced shortly before that release can cause vertical
;; motion commands to skip blank lines when fci-mode is active.  This has
;; been fixed in Emacs trunk.  See github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator/issues/31
;; for further discussion.

;; Installation and Usage
;; ======================

;; Put this file in your load path and put:
;;
;;   (require 'fill-column-indicator)
;;
;; in your init file.

;; To toggle graphical indication of the fill column in a buffer, use the
;; command `fci-mode'.
 
;; Configuration
;; =============

;; By default, fci-mode draws its vertical indicator at the fill column.  If
;; you'd like it to be drawn at another column, set `fci-rule-column' to the
;; column number.  (A case in which this might be useful is when you want to
;; fill comments at, for example, column 70, but want a vertical rule at
;; column 80 or 100 to indicate the maximum line length for code.)  The
;; default behavior (showing the indicator at the fill column) is specified
;; by setting fci-rule-column to nil.  Note that this variable becomes buffer
;; local when set.

;; On graphical displays the fill-column rule is drawn using a bitmap
;; image.  Its color is controlled by the variable `fci-rule-color', whose
;; value can be any valid color name.  The rule's width in pixels is
;; determined by the variable `fci-rule-width'; the default value is 1.

;; The rule can be drawn as a solid or dashed line, controlled by the
;; variable `fci-rule-use-dashes'; the default is nil.  The dash appearance is
;; controlled by `fci-dash-pattern', which is the ratio of dash length to
;; line height; the default is 0.75. (The value should be a number between 0
;; and 1; values outside that interval are coerced to the nearest endpoint.)

;; The image formats fci-mode can use are XPM and PBM.  If Emacs has been
;; compiled with the appropriate library it uses XPM images by default; if
;; not it uses PBM images, which are natively supported.  You can specify a
;; particular choice of format by setting `fci-rule-image-format' explicitly
;; to xpm or pbm.

;; On character terminals the rule is drawn using the character specified by
;; `fci-rule-character'; the default is `|' (ascii 124).  If
;; `fci-rule-character-color' is nil, then it is drawn using fci-rule-color
;; (or the closest approximation thereto that the terminal is capable of); if
;; it is a color name, then that color is used instead.

;; If you'd like the rule to be drawn using fci-rule-character even on
;; graphical displays, set `fci-always-use-textual-rule' to a non-nil value.

;; These variables (as well as those described in the next section) can be
;; given buffer-local bindings.

;; Other Options
;; =============

;; When `truncate-lines' is nil, the effect of drawing a fill-column rule is
;; very odd looking. Indeed, it makes little sense to use a rule to indicate
;; the position of the fill column in that case (the positions at which the
;; fill column falls in the visual display space won't, in general, be
;; collinear).  For this reason, fci-mode sets truncate-lines to t in buffers
;; in which it is enabled and restores it to its previous value when
;; disabled.  You can turn this feature off by setting
;; `fci-handle-truncate-lines' to nil.

;; If `line-move-visual' is t, then vertical navigation can behave oddly in
;; several edge cases while fci-mode is enabled (this is due to a bug in
;; Emacs's C code).  Accordingly, fci-mode sets line-move-visual to nil in
;; buffers in which it is enabled and restores it to its previous value when
;; disabled.  This can be suppressed by setting `fci-handle-line-move-visual'
;; to nil.  (But you shouldn't want to do this.  There's no reason to use
;; line-move-visual if truncate-lines is t, and it doesn't make sense to use
;; something like fci-mode when truncate-lines is nil.)

;; Fci-mode needs free use of two characters (specifically, it needs the use
;; of two characters whose display table entries it can change
;; arbitrarily).  Its defualt is to use the first two characters of the
;; Private Use Area of the Unicode BMP, viz. U+E000 and U+E001.  If you need
;; to use those characters for some other purpose, set `fci-eol-char' and
;; `fci-blank-char' to different values.

;; Troubleshooting
;; ===============

;; o Fci-mode is intended to be used with monospaced fonts.  If you're using
;;   a monospaced font and the fill-column rule is missing or misaligned on a
;;   few lines but otherwise appears normal, then most likely (a) there are
;;   non-ascii characters on those lines that are being displayed using a
;;   non-monospaced font, or (b) your font-lock settings use bold or italics
;;   and those font variants aren't monospaced.

;; o Fci-mode in not currently compatible with Emacs's
;;   `show-trailing-whitespace' feature (given the way the latter is
;;   implemented, such compatibility is going to be hard to achieve).  A
;;   workaround is to configure `whitespace-mode' to replicate the
;;   functionality of show-trailing-whitespace.  This can be done with the
;;   following setting:
;;
;;     (setq whitespace-style '(face trailing))
;;
;;  With this, whitespace-mode produces the same basic effect as a non-nil
;;  value of show-trailing-whitespace, and compatibility with fci-mode is not
;;  a problem.

;; Known Issues
;; ============

;; o The indicator extends only to end of the buffer contents (as opposed to
;;   running the full length of the editing window).

;; o When portions of a buffer are invisible, such as when outline-mode is
;;   used to hide certain lines, the fill-column rule is hidden as well.

;; o Fci-mode should work smoothly when simultaneously displaying the same
;;   buffer on both a graphical display and on a character terminal.  It does
;;   not currently support simultaneous display of the same buffer on window
;;   frames with different default font sizes. (It would be feasible to
;;   support this use case, but thus far there seems to be no demand for
;;   it.)

;; o An issue specific to the Mac OS X (NextStep) port, versions 23.0-23.2:
;;   Emacs won't, in these particular versions, draw a cursor on top of an
;;   image.  Thus on graphical displays the cursor will disappear when
;;   positioned directly on top of the fill-column rule.  The best way to
;;   deal with this is to upgrade to v23.3 or v24 (or downgrade to v22).  If
;;   that isn't practical, a fix is available via the mini-package
;;   fci-osx-23-fix.el, which can be downloaded from:
;;
;;     github.com/alpaker/Fill-Column-Indicator
;;
;;  Directions for its use are given in the file header.

;; Todo
;; ====

;; o Accommodate non-nil values of `hl-line-sticky-flag' and similar cases.

;; o Accommodate linum-mode more robustly.

;; o Compatibility with non-nil `show-trailing-whitespace.'

;; Inspired by zap-to-char, this library defines different routines operating on
;; the next/previous N'th occurrence of a character.  When invoking one of these
;; commands, the user is interactively queried for a character while the
;; potential target positions are highlighted.
;;
;; For example, META-s (jump-to-char-forward) highlights the next occurrences of
;; each character and prompts for one.  Once the user picks a char, the point is
;; moved to that position.  Subsequent invocations of META-s before picking a
;; character increases N, that is, the second, third, etc. occurrences are
;; highlighted and targeted.
;;
;; The fastnav-sprint-forward/backward commands apply iterative
;; jumping until return/C-G is hit, making it possible to reach any
;; point of the text with just a few keystrokes.

;; Provides fake namespaces through a very rudimentary `defpackage',

;; hidden away (by `end-package') where no other package can trample
;; on them.

;; See example.el for an example of using this package.

;; It works by comparing the symbol table before any declarations to
;; the symbol table afterward, then uninterning any symbols that were
;; created and not exported. This will work even on byte-compiled
;; files. In fact, everything is determined at compile-time, so there
;; is practically no load-time penalty from using these fake
;; namespaces.

;; Generally you will not want to actively use these fake namespaces
;; during development because there is no `in-package' function. You
;; will always been in the main namespace unable to access your
;; private functions. Later, when you're finishing up and want to test
;; out your namespace, make sure your code is unloaded from Emacs
;; (i.e. none of your symbols is in the symbol table) before applying
;; your namespace. The same applies to compilation: the package must
;; not be loaded before compilation or the `defpackage' will not hide
;; any symbols.

;; Unfortunately, due to the downright ugly implementation of obarrays
;; in Emacs, it's currently not possible to implement
;; `in-package'. Uninterned symbols cannot be added back to the global
;; obarray (or any other obarray). Symbols are invisibly chained as
;; linked lists in the obarray so it's not possible to put a symbol
;; into two obarrays at the same time -- the chains would
;; conflict. Not only is the required functionality not provided
;; (intentionally), trying to hack it in would break everything.

;;
;;    Extensions to `facemenu.el'.
;;
;;  This library enhances the \"Text Properties\" menu.  It adds menu
;;  items to the menu, and provides two different versions of the
;;  menu: one for the menu-bar Edit menu (`facemenu-menu') and one for
;;  the mouse popup menu (`facemenu-mouse-menu').  In standard library
;;  `facemenu.el', these two menus are the same.
;;
;;  Items are added to each of these menus to examine, copy, and
;;  change foreground and background colors in various ways.
;;
;;  In the `C-mouse-2' popup version of the menu
;;  (`facemenu-mouse-menu'), menu items use the character under the
;;  mouse pointer, instead of the character after the text cursor
;;  (point).  For example, in the mouse menu, \"Describe Properties\"
;;  describes the text properties under the mouse pointer.  This makes
;;  the mouse menu generally more convenient than the menubar menu -
;;  just point and click.
;;
;;  Menu items \"Do Re Mi - *\" make use of commands `doremi-face-fg+'
;;  `doremi-face-bg+', and `doremi-undo-last-face-change', which are
;;  defined in library `doremi-frm.el'.  They let you change the face
;;  color incrementally, using the arrow keys or the mouse wheel, and
;;  undo such changes.
;;
;;  Menu items \"Palette - *\" make use of library `palette.el' (which
;;  is available only for Emacs 22 and later).  They let you use a
;;  color palette to change the color.  You can restore the face color
;;  before as it was before palette editing, by using command
;;  `facemenup-face-bg-restore' or `facemenup-face-fg-restore'.
;;
;;  If option `facemenup-palette-update-while-editing-flag' is nil,
;;  then quitting the palette using `q' cancels any color change you
;;  made there, and exiting the palette using `x' effects the color
;;  change.  If the option is non-nil (the default), then each time
;;  you change the palette color the face color changes as well.  This
;;  lets you see the effect immediately, without exiting the palette,
;;  but you cannot then use `q' in the palette to cancel the edit.
;;  But you can still restore the color as it was before the edit.
;;
;;  Both Do Re Mi and the color palette let you change colors by
;;  changing color components, whether RGB (red, green, blue) or HSV
;;  (hue, saturation, value).
;;
;;  In addition, standard commands `facemenu-set-face' (`M-o o') and
;;  `list-faces-display' have been enhanced to let you pick a face to
;;  apply from the *Faces* display.  The face sample text is an action
;;  button that does this.  The face name is a link to the face
;;  description, which also has a link to customize the face.  If the
;;  region is active when you call either of these functions, then
;;  clicking a face's sample text applies the face to the region;
;;  otherwise, it applies the face to newly entered text.  To use this
;;  feature with `facemenu-set-face', use a numeric prefix argument,
;;  such as `C-8'.
;;
;;  The reason for this enhancement to `facemenu-set-face' and
;;  `list-faces-display' is to let you see what face you are choosing:
;;  its appearance, not just its name.  If you use Icicles, then you
;;  do not need this enhancement, because face names are displayed in
;;  *Completions* with their own faces.
;;
;;  Similarly, standard command `list-colors-display' has been
;;  enhanced to open the color palette on a color when you click it.
;;  (Using the palette to edit the color does not change the original
;;  color's definition.)  The palette is useful in this context mainly
;;  to show you the color in context.  In addition, the tooltip is
;;  improved, showing more precise HSV values and decimal RGB.
;;
;;  Standard command `facemenu-add-face' has also been enhanced here,
;;  so that it prevents the highlighting that you add from being
;;  erased by font lock.  To take advantage of this, you must use
;;  Emacs version 22 or later, and you must also load library
;;  `font-lock+.el'.
;;
;;  If you load library `highlight.el' before you load `facemenu+.el',
;;  then the commands in that library are also added to the Text
;;  Properties menu, as a Highlight submenu.

;; * Introduction
;; I would like to drag files onto a ESS buffer and write the appropriate

;; * Installation
;; To install, put the `extend-dnd.el' somewhere in your load path, and add

;; 
;; 
;; (require 'extend-dnd)
;; (extend-dnd-activate)

;; 
;; After you define a snippet in the major mode you are working with, and put

;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;;

;; 
;; 
;; 
;; Then once this has been defined press `C-cC-d' to add the extension to
;; the drag and drop list. 
;; 
;; The extension will be expanded based on the `key' value.  Therefore,
;; if you want more than one possible action for a particular file, give
;; it the same key.
;; 
;; For example, if you want the possibility to write to the csv you
;; dragged in, you may wish to have the snippet:
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; write.csv(d,\"${1:`yas/selected-text`}\");
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; * Wish List/TODO
;; ** TODO Support dired mode
;; ** TODO Support inferior processes.
;; ** TODO Allow generic Yasnippet expansion by key name (like dnd_csv will automatically do drag and drop for csv files)

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'express)
;;     (express-install-aliases)
;;
;;     (express \"important message\")
;;
;;     (with-message-logonly
;;       (do-something-noisy))
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Express.el provides alternatives to Emacs' built-in `message'
;; function.
;;
;; This library is generally only useful when programming in Emacs
;; Lisp.  However, some end-users may find it useful to control
;; messaging, especially for the case of quietening chatty libraries
;; in their ~/.emacs files (see below).
;;
;; The principal `express' function by default works differently from
;; `message' in almost every respect, displaying with sound and visual
;; highlight, and not writing to the log.  See the `express' docstring
;; for details.  The variant function `express*' has identical
;; functionality, but accepts CL-style arguments.
;;
;; The following functions provided by this library are drop-in
;; alternatives to `message' which may be useful in an `flet'
;; construct:
;;
;;     `express-message-nolog'
;;     `express-message-logonly'
;;     `express-message-highlight'
;;     `express-message-insert'
;;     `express-message-notify'
;;     `express-message-popup'
;;     `express-message-temp'
;;     `express-message-string'
;;
;; The following macros modify the behavior of `message' within
;; the enclosing expression:
;;
;;     `express-with-message-nolog'
;;     `express-with-message-logonly'
;;     `express-with-message-highlight'
;;     `express-with-message-insert'
;;     `express-with-message-notify'
;;     `express-with-message-popup'
;;     `express-with-message-temp'
;;     `express-with-message-string'
;;
;; For example, the following code would redirect messages from a very
;; chatty library to the log:
;;
;;     (express-with-message-nolog
;;       (require 'very-chatty-library))
;;
;; The same method may also be handy with `defadvice':
;;
;;     (defadvice very-chatty-function (around very-chatty-redirect activate)
;;       (express-with-message-nolog
;;         ad-do-it))
;;
;; Similarly, important messages may be redirected to a more visible
;; form:
;;
;;     (defadvice an-important-function (around an-important-function activate)
;;       (express-with-message-notify
;;         ad-do-it))
;;
;; To use `express', place the express.el library somewhere Emacs can find
;; it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'express)
;;     (express-install-aliases)     ; optionally, can also be set in customize
;;
;; Running `express-install-aliases' or setting the corresponding
;; variable in customize will install convenience aliases outside
;; the \"express-\" namespace.  This is disabled by default.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET express RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET notify RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET popup RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     The function `express-message-noformat' is also available, but it
;;     is not quite a drop-in replacement for `message'.
;;
;;     Some of the functions require the availability of notify.el,
;;     todochiku.el or popup.el.  In all cases, the function will
;;     degrade to an ordinary message if the external library is not
;;     present.
;;

;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Soft dependency on unpublished popup-volatile.
;;
;;     `message' is a subr.  Macros such as `express-with-message-logonly'
;;     will only affect calls to `message' from Lisp.

;; For more information on the design of this package, please see the
;; README that came with it.
;;
;; Editing whitespace. I don't like to forcibly clean[1] whitespace
;; because when doing diffs/checkins, it pollutes changesets. However,
;; I prefer clean whitespace -- often I've deleted whitespace by
;; accident and been unable to \"put it back\" for purposes of diffing.
;;
;; Therefore, my approach is hybrid -- maintain clean whitespace where
;; possible, and avoid disturbing messy whitespce when I come across
;; it. I add a find-file-hook to track whether the whitespace of a
;; given file was clean to begin with, and add a before-save-hook that
;; uses this information to forcibly clean whitespace only if it was
;; clean at start.
;;
;; Viewing whitespace. Originally I had a font-lock-mode hook that
;; always called show-trailing-whitespace and show-tabs, but this
;; turns out to be annoying for a lot of reasons. Emacs internal
;; buffers like *Completions* and *Shell* would get highlit. So I
;; decided that a more sophisticated approach was called for.
;;
;; 1) If a buffer does not correspond to a file, I almost certainly do
;; not care whether the whitespace is clean. I'm not going to be
;; saving it, after all.
;;
;; 2) If a buffer corresponds to a file that was originally clean, I
;; still don't really care about the whitespace, since my hook (above)
;; would ensure that it was clean going forward.
;;
;; 3) If a buffer corresponds to a file that was not originally clean,
;; I do care about seeing whitespace, because I do not want to edit it
;; by accident.
;;
;; There are a few exceptions -- if I'm looking at a patch, or hacking
;; a Makefile, whitespace is different. More about those later.
;;
;; This file adds hooks to make this stuff happen -- check whether the
;; whitespace is clean when a file is first found, and preserve that
;; cleanliness if so, and highlight that dirtiness if not. It does
;; this by setting show-trailing-whitespace when necessary.
;;
;; NOTE: take out any customizations like this:
;; '(show-trailing-whitespace t)
;; show-trailing-whitespace will be turned on by ethan-wspace.
;;
;; Also disable '(require-final-newlines t); ethan-wspace will handle

;;
;; - Fix a require issue

;; 1.3.0 (was uploaded as 1.2.4, accidentally)
;;
;; - Fix autoloads - erc-hl-nicks should require itself as needed
;;
;; - reset face table is now interactive
;;
;; - reworked how colors are chosen (should continue to work the same
;;   for everyone, though). See `erc-hl-nicks-color-contrast-strategy'
;;   for details.
;;
;; - Added `erc-hl-nicks-bg-color' to allow terminal users to specify
;;   their background colors
;;
;; - Added `erc-hl-nicks-alias-nick' to allow setting up several nicks
;;   to use the same color
;;
;; - Added `erc-hl-nicks-force-nick-face' to force a nick to use a
;;   specific color

;; 1.2.3 - Updated copyright date

;;
;;       - added highlighting on erc-send-modify-hook

;; 1.2.2 - Added dash to the list of characters to ignore
;;
;;       - Fixed an issue where timestamps could prevent highlighting
;;         from occurring

;; 1.2.1 - Remove accidental use of 'some' which comes from cl

;; 1.2.0 - Added erc-hl-nicks-skip-nicks to give a way to prevent
;;         certain nicks from being highlighted.
;;
;;       - Added erc-hl-nicks-skip-faces to give a way to prevent
;;         highlighting over other faces.  Defaults to:
;;         (erc-notice-face erc-fool-face erc-pal-face)

;;
;;       - The hook is called with a narrowed buffer, so it makes
;;         more sense to iterate over each word, one by one.  This
;;         is more efficient and has a secondary benefit of fixing a
;;         case issue.
;;
;;       - Added an option to not highlight fools

;;
;; Eproject is an extension that lets you group related files together
;; as projects.  It aims to be as unobtrusive as possible -- no new
;; files are created (or required to exist) on disk, and buffers that
;; aren't a member of a project are not affected in any way.
;;
;; The main starting point for eproject is defining project types.
;; There is a macro for this, define-project-type, that accepts four
;; arguments, the type name (a symbol), a list of supertypes (for
;; inheriting properties), a form that is executed to determine
;; whether a file is a member of a project, and then a free-form
;; property list.  An example will clear things up.
;;
;; Let's create a \"perl\" project type, for Perl projects that have a
;; Makefile.PL.
;;
;; (define-project-type perl (generic)
;;   (look-for \"Makefile.PL\")
;;   :relevant-files (\"\\\\.pm$\" \"\\\\.t$\"))
;;
;; Now when you open a file and somewhere above in the directory tree
;; there is a Makefile.PL, it will be a \"perl project\".
;;
;; There are a few things you get with this.  A hook called
;; perl-project-file-visit-hook will be run, and the buffer will have
;; the \"eproject-mode\" minor-mode turned on.  You can also read and
;; set metadata via the eproject-attribute and
;; eproject-add-project-metadatum calls.
;;
;; (This is mostly helpful to Lisp programmers rather than end-users;
;; if you want tools for visiting and managing projects (and ibuffer
;; integration), load `eproject-extras'.  These extras are great
;; examples of the eproject API in action, so please take a look even
;; if you don't want those exact features.)
;;
;; Let's look at the mechanics of the define-project-type call.  The
;; first argument is the name of the project type -- it can be any
;; symbol.  The next argument is a list of other projects types that
;; this project will inherit from.  That means that if you call
;; eproject-get-project-metadatum and the current project doesn't
;; define a value, we'll look at the supertypes until we get something
;; non-nil.  Usually you will want to set this to (generic), which
;; will make your type work correctly even if you don't define any of
;; your own metadata.
;;
;; The next argument is a form that will be executed with the filename
;; that was just opened bound to FILE.  It is expected to return the
;; project root, or nil if FILE is not in a project of this type.  The
;; look-for function will look up the directory tree for a file that
;; is named the same as its argument (see the docstring for
;; `eproject--look-for-impl' for all the details).  You can write any
;; Lisp here you like; we'll see some more examples later.  (You only
;; get one form, so if you need to execute more than one, just wrap it
;; in a progn.)
;;
;; The final (&rest-style) argument is a property list of initial project
;; metadata.  You can put anything you want here, as long as it is in the
;; form of a property list (keyword, value, keyword, value, ...).
;;
;; After this form runs, eproject will be able to recognize files in

;; Add/remove directories to the load path.
;; Add/remove directories to the environment PATH.
;; Add/remove packages to require, including any accompanying setup elisp code.
;; Set/unset and save keybindings.

;; Installation:

;; The package can be installed with M-x package-list-packages (requires
;; package.el, which is included for emacs 24 but availble for 23). The MELPA
;; repository must be added to your packages setup first. Instructions can be found
;; at http://melpa.milkbox.net/

;; Alternatively, the source can be pulled direclty from github:
;; https://github.com/echosa/emacs-setup

;; If you install via package-list-packages, revive.el will be installed for you.
;; If you do not, you will need to manually get, install, and load revive.el.
;; You can find it at http://www.gentei.org/~yuuji/software/revive.el

;; Usage:

;; In your .emacs, load emacs-setup:

;; (load-file \"~/path/to/emacs-setup/emacs-setup.el\")

;; Once loaded, you can use M-x customize-group emacs-setup to setup your
;; environment.

;; emacs-setup is broken down into several parts, which can each be customized
;; individually:

;; emacs-setup - This is the main part of emacs-setup. You can set your base
;;               directory (your .emacs.d or equivalent), directories to ignore
;;               when recursively adding to load path, and various list of
;;               s-expressions (base, pre, post, etc.) The s-expression lists
;;               can be used to setup things that would normally be in your
;;               .emacs, but are not customizable options. For instance,
;;               (set-frame-font), (set-background-color), (transient-mark-mode),
;;               etc. I'm not going to try an support every option of emacs.
;;               Instead, simply add these configuration lines (one sexp per line)
;;               to the appropriate sexp group, depending on when they need to run.
;;               When emacs-setup-base is run, the last thing it does is run all
;;               the s-expressions in emacs-setup-base-sexp. When emacs-setup is
;;               run, it runs in this order:
;;               - emacs-setup-pre-sexp
;;               - require pacakges via emacs-setup-require
;;               - emacs-setup-post-sexp
;;               - bind keys in emacs-setup-keys

;; emacs-setup-keys - This part of emacs-setup allows you to have your keybindings
;;                    all in one place via customize. You can manually add and
;;                    remove keybindings, or you can use the functions
;;                    emacs-setup-bind-key,
;;                    emacs-seutp-unbind-key-by-key, or
;;                    emacs-setup-unbind-key-by-functions
;;                    to interactively bind or unbind keys, which are saved to
;;                    customize for you.
                   
;; emacs-setup-require - This is ths part of emacs-setup where you can tell it
;;                       which packages to load, and give setup s-expressions.
;;                       You can customize the load-path and env-path, whether or
;;                       not to loade elpa and where your package.el is (if not
;;                       using emacs 24). Customizing the variable
;;                       emacs-setup-require-list
;;                       is where you can add which packages should be load, in

;;                       for each package after it is loaded.
;;                       When emacs-setup is run, if any pacakges fail to load, a
;;                       buffer called *invalid-packages* will be displayed telling
;;                       you which failed.

;; 1. Usage

;; 1.A. Overview
;;
;; For example, to try electric-case-mode in java-mode, put following expression
;; into your init file.
;;
;;   (require 'electric-case)
;;
;;   (eval-after-load \"cc-mode\"
;;     (add-hook 'java-mode-hook 'electric-case-java-init))
;;
;; Now, when you type following expression as usual in java-mode,
;;
;;   public class test-class{
;;       public void test-method(void){
;;
;; electric-case will automatically convert it into :
;;
;;   public class TestClass{
;;       public void testMethod(void){

;; Settings for some other languages are also available by default. Try:
;;
;;   (eval-after-load \"cc-mode\"
;;     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook electric-case-c-init))
;;
;;   (eval-after-load \"ahk-mode\"
;;     (add-hook 'ahk-mode-hook electric-case-ahk-init))
;;
;;   (eval-after-load \"scala-mode\"
;;     (add-hook 'scala-mode-hook electric-case-scala-init))
;;
;; If you want to use electric-case-mode on other languages than above,
;; you may make your own setting. Read section 2.

;; 1.B. \"convert-calls\"
;;
;; electric-case do not convert other expressions than declarations, by default. To
;; enable conversion for other expressions, set \"electric-case-convert-calls\" non-nil.
;;
;;   (setq electric-case-convert-calls t)
;;
;; This sometimes produces confusing results for novice users. For example,
;;
;;   foo-bar
;;
;; is not treated as \"foo minus bar\", but converted to
;;
;;   fooBar
;;
;; To make \"-\" treated as subtraction or negation, insert whitespace around it.
;;
;;   foo - bar
;;
;; I recommend to keep \"electric-case-convert-calls\" nil, because convert-calls may be
;; too noisy. Once declared, symbols may be inserted easily using completion. This
;; script is useful when you TYPE camel-case or snake-case symbols. But in case you do
;; not need to type, not to type is much better.

;; 1.C. \"convert-nums\", \"convert-beginning\", and \"convert-end\"
;;
;; Even if \"electric-case-convert-calls\" is non-nil, numbers, and hyphens at beginning/end of
;; symbols are not converted.
;;
;;   -foo-1  =>  -foo-1
;;
;; You may change this behavior by turning some of three variables to non-nil.
;;
;;   (setq electric-case-convert-nums t)      hyphens around numbers
;;   (setq electric-case-convert-beginning t) hyphens at beginning of symbols
;;   (setq electric-case-convert-end t)       hyphens at end of symbols
;;
;; When you insert an expression \"-foo--1--bar-\",
;;
;;                   +---num
;;                   |     +--- num
;;                   V     V
;;    -  f  o  o  -  -  1  -  -  b  a  r  -
;;    ^           ^           ^           ^
;;    |           +--- end    |           +--- end
;;    +--- beginning          +--- beginning
;;
;; electric-case will convert it like:
;;
;;                      num beg end
;;
;;     -foo--1--bar-    nil nil nil
;;     -foo-1--bar      nil nil  t
;;     Foo--1-Bar-      nil  t  nil
;;     -foo1Bar-         t  nil nil
;;     Foo1Bar           t   t   t

;; 1.D. overlays
;;
;; Symbols that are going to converted are printed in gray. If this is not confortable for you,
;; evaluate following expression to disable it.
;;
;;   (setq electric-case-pending-overlay nil)
;;
;; Or you may also choose another face for overlay.
;;
;;   (setq electric-case-pending-overlay 'highlight)

;; 1.E. disable electric-case
;;
;; If you want to disable electric-case temporally, use command \"M-x electric-case-mode\"
;; or evaluate expression below :
;;
;;   (electric-case-mode -1)
;;
;; To activate again, call the same command again, or evaluate expression below :
;;
;;   (electric-case-mode 1)

;; 2. Language Configuration

;; There are two important buffer-local variables. To add settings for other languages,
;; configure them.

;; - electric-case-criteria
;;
;;   Set a function that defines which case to convert the symbol into. The function
;;   will be given 2 arguments: the beginning and the end point of the symbol that is
;;   going to be converted. The function must return one of 'camel, 'ucamel, 'snake,
;;   'usnake, or nil. When the return value is nil, conversion for the symbol is canceled.
;;
;;   Remember, that if \"electric-case-convert-calls\" is nil, symbols not in declarations are
;;   not expected to be converted. electric-case does not judge if the symbol is in a
;;   declaration. So criteria function should return nil in that case.
;;
;;   Here is an example:
;;
;;     (setq electric-case-criteria
;;           (lambda (b e n)
;;             (let ((proper (text-properties-at b)))
;;               (cond ((member 'font-lock-function-name-face proper) 'snake)
;;                     ((member 'font-lock-variable-name-face proper)
;;                      (if (member '(cpp-macro) (c-guess-basic-syntax))
;;                          'usnake 'snake))
;;                     (electric-case-convert-calls 'snake)
;;                     (t nil)))))
;;
;;   with criteria above, function declarations and variable declarations are converted
;;   into snake_case. Macro declarations are converted into UP_SNAKE_CASE. Other expressions
;;   are converted into snake_case, if \"electric-case-convert-calls\" is non-nil. Otherwise,
;;   are not converted, even if that contain \"-\". This may be one of the minimal criterias
;;   for C-language.

;; - electric-case-max-iteration
;;
;;   For example, in Java, the syntactical category of the symbol \"what-is-this\" below
;;   is not decidable.
;;
;;     what-is-this
;;
;;   But when \"symbol;\" is added, now \"what-is-this\" is a name of a class.
;;
;;     what-is-this symbol;
;;
;;   So electric-case can convert it.
;;
;;     WhatIsThis symbol;
;;
;;   In the example above, the symbol \"what-is-this\" must be checked twice. Then,
;;   \"electric-case-max-iteration\" must be 2 or greater. Otherwise, \"what-is-this\" is
;;   not checked twice, and not be converted.

;; ECB stands for \"Emacs Code Browser\".  While Emacs already has good
;; *editing* support for many modes, its *browsing* support is somewhat
;; lacking. That's where ECB comes in: it displays a number of informational
;; windows that allow for easy source code navigation and overview.
;;
;; The informational windows can contain:
;;
;; - A directory tree,
;; - a list of source files in the current directory,
;; - a list of functions/classes/methods/... in the current file, (ECB uses
;;   the Semantic Bovinator, or Imenu, or etags, for getting this list so all
;;   languages supported by any of these tools are automatically supported by
;;   ECB too)
;; - a history of recently visited files, 
;; - the Speedbar and
;; - output from compilation (the \"*compilation*\" window) and other modes like
;;   help, grep etc. or whatever a user defines to be displayed in this
;;   window.
;;
;; As an added bonus, ECB makes sure to keep these informational windows visible,
;; even when you use C-x 1 and similar commands.
;;
;; It goes without saying that you can configure the layout, ie which
;; informational windows should be displayed where. ECB comes with a number of
;; ready-made window layouts to choose from.

;;; Installation
;;
;; To use the Emacs code browser add the ECB files to your load path and add the
;; following line to your .emacs file:
;;
;; If you want autoloading ECB after first start:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb-autoloads)
;;
;; or if you want loading the complete ECB:
;;
;;    (require 'ecb)
;;
;; Optional: You can byte-compile ECB with `ecb-byte-compile' after the
;;           ECB-package is loaded


;;; Requirements
;;
;; - Semantic, author-version between >= 1.4
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/semantic.shtml).
;; - Eieio, author-version >= 0.17
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml).
;; - speedbar, author version >= 0.14beta1
;;   (http://cedet.sourceforge.net/speedbar.shtml)
;; - Optional: If Java code is edited the ECB works best when the JDEE package
;;   (http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde) is installed.


;;; Activation
;;
;; ECB is either activated and started by calling
;;    M-x ecb-activate
;; or
;;    via the menu \"Tools --> Start Code Browser (ECB)\"
;;
;; ECB can also be (de)activated/toggled by M-x ecb-minor-mode.
;;
;; After activating ECB you should call `ecb-show-help' to get a detailed
;; description of what ECB offers to you and how to use ECB.


;;; Availability
;;
;; The latest version of the ECB is available at http://ecb.sourceforge.net

;;; History
;;
;; For the ChangeLog of this file see the CVS-repository. For a complete
;; history of the ECB-package see the file NEWS.

;; This is an demonstration implementation of introducing window management to Emacs.
;; * Management of list of editable buffers
;; * Assignment of windows for pop-up buffers
;; * Switching window layout like the perspective in eclipse
;; * Plug-in extension 

;; The current implementation has following perspectives:
;; * code      : main coding layout
;; * two       : side by side layout
;; * doc       : reading documentation layout
;; * dashboard : showing plug-ins like dashboard in Mac OSX
;; * array     : selecting buffers like expose in Mac OSX

;;; Installation:

;; (1) Put e2wm.el and window-layout.el in load-path.
;; (2) Put the following code in your .emacs file,
;;    (require 'e2wm)
;; (3) M-x e2wm:start-management to start e2wm.
;; To stop e2wm, M-x e2wm:stop-management or [C-c ; Q].


;;; Customization

;; * Layout recipe (`e2wm:c-PST-NAME-recipe'):

;; Layout recipe RECIPE (e.g., `e2wm:c-code-recipe') is a recursive
;; tree-like structure defined as follows:

;; (SPLIT-TYPE [SPLIT-OPTION]
;;             WINDOW-or-RECIPE    ; left or upper side
;;             WINDOW-or-RECIPE)   ; right or lower side

;; WINDOW is a name (symbol) of the window. This is used in the
;; `:name' property of the window information list (winfo, see the
;; next section).

;; Split types (SPLIT-TYPE):

;;   - : split vertically
;;   | : split horizontally

;; Split option list SPLIT-OPTION is a plist with the following
;; properties. (the prefix 'left' can be replaced by 'right', 'upper'
;; and 'lower'.):

;;   :left-size        : (column or row number) window size
;;   :left-max-size    : (column or row number) if window size is larger
;;                     : than this value, the window is shrunken.
;;   :left-size-ratio  : (0.0 - 1.0) window size ratio. the size of
;;                     : the other side is the rest.
;;
;; Note:
;; The split option can be omitted.
;; The size parameters, :size, :max-size and :size-ratio, are mutually
;; exclusive.  The size of a window is related with one of the other
;; side window. So, if both side windows set size parameters, the
;; window size may not be adjusted as you write.

;; * Window information  (`e2wm:c-PST-NAME-winfo'):

;; Window information (e.g., `e2wm:c-code-winfo') is a list of window
;; options (plist).  Besides the options defined in window-layout.el,
;; `:name' (mandatory), `:buffer', `:default-hide' and `:fix-size',
;; e2wm has additional options.

;;   :name      [*] : the window name.
;;   :buffer        : A buffer name or a buffer object to show the window.
;;                  : If nil or omitted, the current buffer remains.
;;   :default-hide  : If t, the window is hided initially.
;;                  : (type: t or nil, default: nil)
;;   :fix-size      : If t, when the windows are laid out again, the

;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'dynamic-fonts)
;;
;;     (dynamic-fonts-setup)     ; finds \"best\" fonts and sets faces:
;;                               ; default, fixed-pitch, variable-pitch
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Dynamic-fonts.el makes font configuration more portable between
;; machines.  When Emacs is starting up, dynamic-fonts chooses fonts
;; for your basic faces based on which fonts are actually available
;; on your system.
;;
;; You may set a list of fonts in order of preference using customize.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET dynamic-fonts RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET font-utils RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.4-devel     : yes, at the time of writing
;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 23.3           : yes
;;     GNU Emacs version 22.3 and lower : no
;;
;;     Requires font-utils.el
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Checking for font availability is slow on most systems.  This
;;     library can add up to several seconds to startup time.
;;     Workaround: where supported, font information will be cached
;;     to disk.  See customization options for font-utils.

"]) (dtrt-indent . [(20130301 855) nil "Adapt to foreign indentation offsets" tar ";;; Commentary:

;; A minor mode that guesses the indentation offset originally used
;; for creating source code files and transparently adjusts the
;; corresponding settings in Emacs, making it more convenient to edit
;; foreign files.
;;
;; This hooks into many major modes - c-mode, java-mode, shell-mode
;; and ruby-mode, to name but a few - and makes an educated guess on
;; which offset is appropriate by analyzing indentation levels in the
;; file.
;;
;; Heuristics are used to estimate the proper indentation offset and
;; therefore this system is not infallible, however adjustments will
;; only be made if the guess is considered reliable.  This way it
;; should leave you off no worse than before.
;;
;; To install,
;;   (require 'dtrt-indent)
;;   (dtrt-indent-mode 1)
;;
;; The default settings have been carefully chosen and tested to work
;; reliably on a wide range of source files.  However, if it doesn't
;; work for you they can be fine tuned using M-x customize-group
;; dtrt-indent
;;
;; There is more extensive information in the dtrt-indent info page
;; which you currently need to install manually.
;;
;; Improvements over guess-offset.el:
;;
;; - Whereas guess-offset only worked for C, C++ and Java files,
;;   dtrt-indent supports plenty of major modes (Shell script, Perl
;;   and Ruby are worth mentioning) and is easier to adapt to other
;;   languages.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent is now a minor mode and can be switched on and off,
;;   both globally and locally (the latter using a File Variable).
;;
;; - dtrt-indent is more precise in analyzing the syntax of source
;;   files, making its guess more accurate (it now ignores lines in
;;   comments, multi-line expressions, here documents and the like.)
;;
;; - dtrt-indent stops analyzing a source file after a customizable
;;   amount of lines, making it operate faster on large source files.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent leaves alone files that explicitly set the
;;   indentation offset with a File Variable.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent comes with diagnostic functions to help you
;;   understand what it does behind the scenes, adapt it to new
;;   languages or fine-tune its parameters.
;;
;; - The name of the script has been changed to better reflect its
;;   purpose.
;;
;; - The customization group is now a child of the convenience and
;;   files groups instead of the tools group.
;;
;; - The customization variables are named more sensibly and are
;;   better documented.
;;
;; - Documentation is improved and no longer confusingly refers to
;;   \"tab width\" instead of \"indentation offset\".
;;
;; Files not touched by dtrt-indent:
;;
;; - Files that specify the corresponding variable
;;   (e.g. c-basic-offset) as a File Variable.
;;
;; - Files that specify dtrt-indent-mode: 0 as a File Variable.
;;
;; - Files for which dtrt-indent-accept-file-function returns nil.
;;
;; - Files with a major mode that dtrt-indent doesn't hook into.
;;
;; - Files for which the indentation offset cannot be guessed
;;   reliably.
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; - dtrt-indent can't deal well with files that use variable
;;   indentation offsets, e.g. files that use varying indentation
;;   based on the outer construct.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent currently only supports a limited number of languages
;;   (major-modes).
;;
;; - dtrt-indent only guesses the indendation offset, not the
;;   indentation style.  For instance, it does not detect whether a
;;   C-like file uses hanging braces or not.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent can't deal well with files that mix hard tabs with
;; - spaces for indentation.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - verbose and diagnostics messages
;; - make sure variable documentation match their function
;; - make sure defaults are sensible
;; - complete info page
;; - bulk (real world) tests
;; - functional tests
;; - unit tests

"]) (dsvn . [(20130120 1257) nil "Subversion interface" single ";;; Commentary:
;; 
;; This is an interface for managing Subversion working copies.  It
;; can show you an up-to-date view of the current status, and commit
;; changes. If also helps you do other tasks such as updating,
;; switching, diffing and more.
;;
;; To get you started, add this line to your startup file:
;;
;;  (autoload 'svn-status \"dsvn\" \"Run `svn status'.\" t)
;;  (autoload 'svn-update \"dsvn\" \"Run `svn update'.\" t)
;;
;; This file integrates well with vc-svn, so you might want to do this
;; as well:
;;
;;   (require 'vc-svn)
;;
;; To get the status view, type
;;
;;   M-x svn-status
;;
;; and select a directory where you have a checked-out Subversion
;; working copy.  A buffer will be created that shows what files you
;; have modified, and any unknown files.  The file list corresponds
;; closely to that produced by \"svn status\", only slightly
;; reformatted.
;;
;; Navigate through the file list using \"n\" and \"p\", for next and
;; previous file, respectively.
;;
;; You can get a summary of available commands by typing \"?\".
;;
;; Some commands operate on files, and can either operate on the file
;; under point, or on a group of files that have been marked.  The
;; commands used for marking a file are the following:
;;
;;   m      mark and go down  
;;   DEL    unmark and go up  
;;   u      unmark and go down
;;   SPC    toggle mark       
;;   M-DEL  unmark all       
;;
;; The commands that operate on files are:
;;
;;   f      Visit the file under point (does not use marks)
;;   o      Visit the file under point in another window (does not use marks)
;;   =      Show diff of uncommitted changes.  This does not use marks
;;            unless you give a prefix argument (C-u) 
;;   c      Commit files
;;   a      Add files
;;   r      Remove files
;;   R      Resolve conflicts
;;   M      Rename/move files
;;   U      Revert files
;;   P      View or edit properties of the file or directory under point
;;            (does not use marks)
;;   l      Show log of file or directory under point (does not use marks)
;;
;; These commands update what is shown in the status buffer:
;;
;;   g      Rerun \"svn status\" to update the list.  Use a prefix
;;            argument (C-u) to clear the list first to make sure that
;;            it is correct.
;;   s      Update status of selected files
;;   S      Show status of specific file or directory
;;   x      Expunge unchanged files from the list
;;
;; To update the working copy:
;;
;;   M-u    Run \"svn update\".  If a prefix argument is given (C-u),
;;            you will be prompted for a revision to update to.
;;   M-s    Switch working copy to another branch.
;;   M-m    Merge in changes using \"svn merge\".
;;
;; To view the Subversion log, type \"M-x svn-log\".
;;
;; Bugs and missing features:
;; 
;; - Annotate (blame).
;; - Log, with a useful log mode where the user can easily view any revision
;;   as a diff or visit a revision of a file in a buffer.
;; - Integration with ediff or similar to resolve conflicts.

;; dpaste.el provides functions to post a region or buffer to
;; <http://dpaste.com> and put the paste URL into the kill-ring.

;; Inspired by gist.el

;; Current dpaste.com API usage example:

;;         grep ^Location: | colrm 1 10

;; Thanks to Paul Bissex (http://news.e-scribe.com) for a great paste
;; service.

;; Installation and setup:

;; Put this file in a directory where Emacs can find it. On GNU/Linux
;; it's usually /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/ and on Windows it's
;; something like \"C:\\Program Files\\Emacs<version>\\site-lisp\". Then
;; add the follow instructions in your .emacs.el:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-c p\") 'dpaste-region-or-buffer)

;; Then with C-c p you can run `dpaste-region-or-buffer'. With a prefix
;; argument (C-u C-c p), your paste will use the hold option.

;; - Use emacs lisp code to post paste instead curl (version 0.3)

;;
;; Purpose of this package: minor mode to repeat typing or commands
;;
;; Installation instructions
;;
;; Install this file somewhere in your load path, byte-compile it and
;; add one of the following to your .emacs file (remove the comment
;; delimiters ;-)
;;
;; If you only want dot-mode to activate when you press \"C-.\", add the
;; the following to your .emacs:
;;
;;     (autoload 'dot-mode \"dot-mode\" nil t) ; vi `.' command emulation
;;     (global-set-key [(control ?.)] (lambda () (interactive) (dot-mode 1)
;;                                       (message \"Dot mode activated.\")))
;;
;; If you want dot-mode all the time (like me), add the following to
;; your .emacs:
;;
;;     (require 'dot-mode)
;;     (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'dot-mode-on)
;; 
;; You may still want to use the global-set-key above.. especially if you
;; use the *scratch* buffer.
;;
;; To toggle dot mode on or off type `M-x dot-mode'
;;
;; There are only two variables that allow you to modify how dot-mode
;; behaves:
;;           dot-mode-ignore-undo
;;           dot-mode-global-mode
;;
;; dot-mode-ignore-undo - defaults to t.  When nil, it will record keystrokes
;;     that generate an undo just like any other keystroke that changed the
;;     buffer.  I personally find that annoying, but if you want dot-mode to
;;     always remember your undo's:
;;         (setq dot-mode-ignore-undo nil)
;;     Besides, you can always use dot-mode-override to record an undo when
;;     you need to (or even M-x undo).
;;
;; dot-mode-global-mode - defaults to t.  When t, dot-mode only has one
;;     keyboard command buffer.  That means you can make a change in one
;;     buffer, switch buffers, then repeat the change.  When set to nil,
;;     each buffer gets its own command buffer.  That means that after
;;     making a change in a buffer, if you switch buffers, that change
;;     cannot repeated.  If you switch back to the first buffer, your
;;     change can then be repeated again.  This has a nasty side effect
;;     if your change yanks from the kill-ring (You could end up
;;     yanking text you killed in a different buffer).
;;     If you want to set this to nil, you should do so before dot-mode
;;     is activated on any buffers.  Otherwise, you may end up with some
;;     buffers having a local command buffer and others using the global
;;     one.
;;
;; Usage instructions:
;;
;; `C-.'    is bound to dot-mode-execute, which executes the buffer of
;;          stored commands as a keyboard macro.
;;
;; `C-M-.'  is bound to dot-mode-override, which will cause dot-mode
;;          to remember the next keystroke regardless of whether it
;;          changes the buffer and regardless of the value of the
;;          dot-mode-ignore-undo variable.
;;
;; `C-c-.'  is bound to dot-mode-copy-to-last-kbd-macro, which will
;;          copy the current dot mode keyboard macro to the last-kbd-macro
;;          variable.  It can then be executed via call-last-kbd-macro
;;          (normally bound to `C-x-e'), named via name-last-kbd-macro,
;;          and then inserted into your .emacs via insert-kbd-macro.
;;
;; Known bugs:
;;
;; none
;;

;; EMACS vs. VI
;;
;; This mode is written to address one argument in the emacs vs. vi
;; jihad :-)  It emulates the vi `redo' command, repeating the
;; immediately preceding sequence of commands.  This is done by
;; recording input commands which change the buffer, i.e. not motion
;; commands.

;; DESIGN
;;
;; The heart of this minor mode is a state machine.  The function
;; dot-mode-after-change is called from after-change-functions and
;; sets a variable (is there one already?  I couldn't find it) which
;; is examined by dot-mode-loop, called from from post-command-hook.
;; This variable, dot-mode-changed, is used in conjunction with
;; dot-mode-state to move to the next state in the state machine.
;; The state machine is hard coded into dot-mode-loop in the
;; interests of speed; it uses two normal states (idle and store)
;; and two corresponding override states which allow the user to
;; forcibly store commands which do not change the buffer.

(defconst dot-mode-version \"1.10\"
  \"Report bugs to: Robert Wyrick <rob@wyrick.org>\")

;;; CHANGE HISTORY
;;;
;;; 1.1
;;; Wrote dot-mode.el
;;;
;;; 1.2
;;; At the suggestion of Scott Evans <gse@ocsystems.com>, added
;;; 'dot-mode-override' to allow the user to force dot mode to store a
;;; motion command
;;;
;;; 1.3
;;; Changed dot-mode-loop to use a state machine instead of several
;;; booleans
;;;
;;; 1.4
;;; Hard coded the state machine into dot-mode-loop in the hope of
;;; speeding it up
;;;
;;; 1.5
;;; Ported to GNU Emacs - nearly: the keymap doesn't seem to install
;;; correctly.
;;;
;;; 1.6
;;; Rob Wyrick (that's me) took over maintenance of the package from
;;; Jim Gillespie.
;;;
;;; In some versions of Emacs, (this-command-keys) returns a empty
;;; vector by the time it is called from the 'post-command-hook.
;;; So, I split the functionality... now dot-mode-command-keys
;;; stores (this-command-keys) output in a temp variable to be used
;;; by dot-mode-loop and dot-mode-command-keys is called from the
;;; pre-command-hook.  Also re/ported to XEmacs/GNU Emacs.  It works
;;; on both now.  dot-mode-command-keys could have been put on the
;;; after-change-functions hook, but I've begun preliminary work to
;;; capture what's going on in the minibuffer and I'm certain I need
;;; it where it is.
;;;
;;; 1.7
;;; Added my first attempt to capture what the user is doing with
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  It even works if the executed
;;; command prompts the user.
;;; Also added some error recovery if the user interrupts or there is
;;; an error during execution of the stored macro.
;;;
;;; 1.8
;;; Second attempt to capture what the user is doing with 
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  The previous version didn't work
;;; in XEmacs.  This version works in both XEmacs and GNUEmacs.
;;;
;;; 1.9
;;; Third attempt to capture what the user is doing with 
;;; execute-extended-command (M-x).  Wow was I making things hard.
;;; It's cost me a lot of version numbers in a short amount of time,
;;; so we won't discuss my previous attempts. *grin*  My second attempt
;;; worked just fine, but it was more complicated and maybe not as
;;; portable to older version of X/GNU Emacs.
;;; Other things:
;;;   - Yet another restructuring of the code.  By doing so, 
;;;     quoted-insert (C-q) is properly stored by dot-mode.
;;;     (quoted-insert has been broken since ver 1.6)
;;;   - Deleted an extraneous state and the \"extended-state\" added
;;;     in ver 1.8.  We're down to just two normal states and two
;;;     override states.
;;;   - Added dot-mode-ignore-undo and dot-mode-global-mode variables
;;;     as well as the new function dot-mode-copy-to-last-kbd-macro.
;;;
;;; 1.10
;;; Fixed a bug where the META key wasn't properly recorded on GNU
;;; Emacs.  Actually, if you used ESC for META (like me), everything
;;; worked fine.  But using ALT for META was broken.
;;; Now I'm using this-command-keys-vector when I can.
;;; I also added the dot-mode-event-to-string function to make the
;;; output a little prettier.
;;; Thanks to Scott Evans <gse@antisleep.com> for reporting the bug!
;;;
;;; 1.11
;;; Fixed a bug where dot-mode would give an error if you used
;;; dot-mode-override to record a <right> and then tried to call
;;; dot-mode-execute.  The bug was in dot-mode-event-to-string
;;; Thanks to Scott Evans <gse@antisleep.com> for reporting the bug!

;;    Do Re Mi commands to incrementally adjust face attributes and
;;    frame parameters using arrow keys or mouse wheel.
;;
;;  When you invoke the Do Re Mi iterative commands defined here, you
;;  can press and hold an up/down arrow key, or rotate the mouse
;;  wheel, to change face attributes or frame parameters.  For more
;;  information, see file `doremi.el' and the doc-string for function
;;  `doremi' in particular.
;;
;;  NOTE: Functions and variables in this library have the prefix
;;        `doremi-'.  In order to more easily distinguish commands
;;        that iterate in Do Re Mi fashion from other functions in the
;;        library, the iterative commands are suffixed with `+'.
;;
;;  Note on saving changes made with the commands defined here:
;;
;;    Some of the commands defined here change face and frame
;;    parameters.  You can save any changes you have made, by using
;;    Customize.  To visit a Customize buffer of all unsaved changes
;;    you have made, use command `customize-customized'.
;;
;;    Frame parameter changes, such as background color, can be saved
;;    for future use by all frames or all frames of a certain kind.
;;    For that, you must change the frame parameters of the
;;    correponding frame-alist variable.
;;
;;    There is no single variable for saving changes to parameters of
;;    the current frame.  Instead, there are several different
;;    frame-alist variables, which you can use to define different
;;    kinds of frames.  These include: `default-frame-alist',
;;    `initial-frame-alist', and `special-display-frame-alist'.  The
;;    complete list of such frame alist variables is available using
;;    function `frame-alist-var-names', defined in library
;;    `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;    Example: Suppose you change the background color of a frame and
;;    want to make that the default background color for new frames in
;;    the future.  You will need to update the value of variable
;;    `default-frame-alist' to use the `background-color' parameter
;;    setting of the changed frame.
;;
;;    You can easily copy one or all parameter values from any given
;;    frame to any frame alist (such as `default-frame-alist'), by
;;    using the commands `set-frame-alist-parameter-from-frame' and
;;    `set-all-frame-alist-parameters-from-frame'.  Those commands are
;;    defined in library `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;  Note on available color names:
;;
;;    Color names supported by your Emacs release and platform are
;;    those returned by function `x-color-names'.  This often includes
;;    names that are essentially the same as duplicates, e.g.,
;;    \"LightBlue\" and \"light blue\".  By default, Do Re Mi
;;    canonicalizes these names by lowercasing them and removing
;;    whitespace.  Then it removes the duplicates.  This behavior is
;;    governed by option `hexrgb-canonicalize-defined-colors-flag'.
;;    Customize that option to nil if you need the original names.

;;        that iterate in Do Re Mi fashion from other functions in the
;;        library, the iterative commands are suffixed with `+'.
;;
;;  If you also use library `crosshairs.el' (which requires libraries
;;  `hl-line.el', `hl-line+.el', `vline.el', and `col-highlight.el'),
;;  then commands `doremi-marks+' and `doremi-global-marks+' use
;;  crosshairs to highlight the mark positions when you visit them.
;;
;;  Note on saving changes made with the commands defined here:
;;
;;    Some of the commands defined here change face and frame
;;    properties. You can save any changes you have made, by using
;;    Customize. To visit a Customize buffer of all unsaved changes
;;    you have made, use command `customize-customized'.
;;
;;    Frame parameter changes, such as background color, can be saved
;;    for future use by all frames or all frames of a certain
;;    kind. For that, you must change the frame parameters of the
;;    correponding frame-alist variable.
;;
;;    There is no single variable for saving changes to parameters of
;;    the current frame. Instead, there are several different
;;    frame-alist variables, which you can use to define different
;;    kinds of frames. These include: `default-frame-alist',
;;    `initial-frame-alist', and `special-display-frame-alist'. The
;;    complete list of such frame alist variables is available using
;;    function `frame-alist-var-names', defined in library
;;    `frame-cmds.el'.
;;
;;    Example: Suppose you change the background color of a frame and
;;    want to make that the default background color for new frames in
;;    the future. You will need to update the value of variable
;;    `default-frame-alist' to use the `background-color' parameter
;;    setting of the changed frame.
;;
;;    You can easily copy one or all parameter values from any given
;;    frame to any frame alist (such as `default-frame-alist'), by
;;    using the commands `set-frame-alist-parameter-from-frame' and
;;    `set-all-frame-alist-parameters-from-frame'. Those commands are
;;    defined in library `frame-cmds.el'.

;;
;;    Do Re Mi: Incremental change using arrow keys or mouse wheel.
;;
;; When you invoke Do Re Mi commands, you can then press and hold an
;; up/down arrow key, or turn the mouse wheel, to run up and down the
;; scale: do, re, mi,...
;;
;; Use the up/down arrow keys or the mouse wheel to:
;;
;;  - Change nearly any parameter incrementally (dynamically).
;;
;;  - Repeat an action.
;;
;;  - Cycle through a set of values, without changing anything (for
;;    example, to choose an item).  In this use, think of choosing
;;    from a menu.  This is similar to using a minibuffer history.
;;    The input choices can take the form of any Emacs-Lisp sequence
;;    (list, array, string, vector) - this sequence is converted to a
;;    circular structure (ring).
;;
;;  - Do just about anything: call a different function for each
;;    arrow.
;;
;; This works with numerical parameters that can be incremented and
;; decremented, and it works with parameters that can take on one of a
;; number of values.  In fact, it is even more general than that: you
;; can use it to associate nearly any function or pair of functions
;; with the arrow keys and the mouse wheel.
;;
;; By default, the up and down arrow keys are used, but any other keys
;; may be used instead.  Mouse wheel movements are recognized for
;; Emacs 20 and Emacs 21 (using library `mwheel.el').  `mouse-2'
;; presses are ignored, so that they won't interfere with rotating the
;; wheel.
;;
;; See the doc string for function `doremi' for more information.
;;
;; Code defining a few example commands is included here (but
;; commented out), so you can see how to use this.  For more examples
;; of using function `doremi', see files `doremi-frm.el' and
;; `doremi-cmd.el'.
;;
;; For Emacs prior to release 23, this library requires library
;; `ring+.el', which provides extensions to the standard library
;; `ring.el' to let you manipulate circular structures.  (Library
;; `ring+.el' is part of GNU Emacs 23 and later.)
;;
;;
;;  Non-interactive functions defined here:
;;
;;    `doremi', `doremi-intersection', `doremi-limit',
;;    `doremi-set-new-value', `doremi-wrap'.
;;
;;  User options (variables) defined here:
;;
;;    `doremi-boost-down-keys', `doremi-boost-scale-factor',
;;    `doremi-boost-up-keys', `doremi-down-keys', `doremi-up-keys'.
;;
;;  Add this to your initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/_emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'doremi)
;;
;;  See also these related libraries that make use of `doremi':
;;
;;    `doremi-frm.el' - Incrementally adjust frame properties.
;;    `doremi-cmd.el' - Other Do Re Mi commands.
;;    `doremi-mac.el' - Macro to define Do Re Mi commands and
;;                      automatically add them to Do Re Mi menu.
;;
;;  This has been tested on GNU Emacs 20, 21, and 22 on MS Windows.
;;
;;
;; TO DO?:
;;
;;   - Replace `boost-*' keys by test for modifiers (as for wheel).
;;   - Combine with customize.  That is, have customize buffers use
;;     Do Re Mi commands to defined numeric or enumeration values.
;;   - Provide buttons (menu items) in menus that act like up & down
;;     arrows.

;; If you are working with XML documents, the parsed data structure
;; returned by the XML parser (xml.el) may be enough for you: Lists of
;; lists, symbols, strings, plus a number of accessor functions.
;;
;; If you want a more elaborate data structure to work with your XML
;; document, you can create a document object model (DOM) from the XML
;; data structure using dom.el.
;;
;; You can create a DOM from XML using `dom-make-document-from-xml'.
;; Note that `xml-parse-file' will return a list of top level elements
;; found in the file, so you must choose one element in that list.
;; Here's an example:
;;
;; (setq doc (dom-make-document-from-xml (car (xml-parse-file \"sample.xml\"))))
;;
;; Note that this DOM implementation uses the attributes and tag names
;; used by the XML parser.  If the XML parser uses symbols instead of
;; string (like xml.el does), then dom.el will also use symbols.  If the
;; XML parsers uses strings (like xml-parse.el does), then dom.el will
;; use strings.
;;
;; It should be trivial to write functions analogous to the
;; dom-*-from-xml functions in order to use an another XML parsers (from

;;; On Interfaces and Classes

;; The elisp DOM implementation uses the dom-node structure to store all

;; This package, which is intended for use with GNU Emacs 20/21,
;; implements a menu and a dialogue that consist of a set of radio
;; buttons and toggles to control sort order in dired mode.  The menu
;; is added as a submenu to the Immediate menu, and bound to S-mouse-2
;; as a popup menu.  The dialogue can be accessed via the menu or the
;; dired key binding `C-d' or the command `dired-sort-dialogue', which
;; *must* be run in a dired buffer!  The dialogue uses the Emacs
;; widget library, which does not require GUI support but uses it if
;; available.  The dialogue can be used with a character-based
;; display; the main keys to use are <TAB> and <RET> if a mouse is not
;; available or does not work.  With a GUI the dialogue pops up its
;; own frame by default; otherwise it uses part of the dired window.
;; This is controlled by the customizable user option
;; `dired-sort-dialogue-own-frame'.

;; The menu and dialogue support the `ls' sort switches [tSXUucrR].
;; These are all implemented by GNU `ls'; the subset [tSucr] are
;; implemented by the standard Emacs 20 `ls-lisp' emulation and all
;; are implemented by the Emacs 21 `ls-lisp' (see above URL).
;; Changing a main sort option turns off reverse sorting; toggling
;; reverse sorting does not change the main sort option.  Setting any
;; prefix argument before selecting a sort order reverses it
;; (e.g. press `C-u' or `C-number' or `M-number' BEFORE accessing the
;; menu bar).  The menu also supports two Emacs 21 `ls-lisp' switches:
;; `ls-lisp-ignore-case' ignores case in alphanumeric sorts and
;; `ls-lisp-dirs-first' lists all directories first.  (These latter
;; two switches improve compatibility with Microsoft Windows
;; Explorer.)

;; The toggles for reverse sorting, `ls-lisp-ignore-case' and
;; `ls-lisp-dirs-first', are bound respectively to the keys \"r\", \"c\"
;; and \"b\" in the dired map.

;; A `Configuration' submenu allows a dired sort configuration to be
;; saved or restored, the current and saved configurations to be
;; swaped (bound to \"T\" for \"toggle\"), or the default to be restored.
;; The saved configuration is saved as a customization, which can also
;; be changed directly.  This submenu also allows
;; `dired-sort-dialogue-own-frame' to be toggled.

;; If a `dired-sort-menu' option causes an error (but not if it is
;; just ignored) then it is automatically disabled via the
;; customization facility.  This is useful because not all `ls' and
;; `ftp' programs support the same sort options.

;; The dialogue allows the setting of arbitrary combinations of dired
;; sort options together, without requiring multiple menu accesses.
;; Each dired buffer has its own dialogue.  This dialogue can be left
;; displayed, in which case it is automatically updated to reflect any
;; changes to its dired buffer that are made by other means.  For
;; tidiness, a dialogue buffer is automatically killed whenever it or
;; its dired buffer becomes invisible.

;; To do:
;;   test `dired-sort-menu-invalid-options' facility;
;;   per-host `dired-sort-menu-invalid-options-remote';
;;   cascade multiple dialogue frames?

;;; Installation:

;; Put this file somewhere where Emacs can find it (i.e. in one of the

;; byte-compile it (recommended), and put this in your .emacs:

;; dired-efap.el allows the user to edit the filename at point, by hitting
;; a key (like f2) or double-clicking it.  The name is edited in the dired
;; buffer, and the renaming takes effect when the user hits the RET
;; key.  Only the name of the file at point is tangible and editable, and it
;; uses an special font.
;;
;; This package provides a similar user interface to renaming files to the
;; interface used by some graphical file managers (or \"explorers\", however they
;; are called).
;;
;; The idea for this file was originated from a suggestion I received from Eli
;; Tziperman to improve wdired.

;; This library provides the command `dired-find-duplicates' which searches a directory for
;; duplicates of the marked files in the current dired buffer.
;; It requires that the unix find and md5sum commands are on your system.

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put dired-dups.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;

;;          Sunrise Commander
;; * 1.3.1: Allow \"misc lines (total used, find-dired statuses, etc)\" to be hidden;
;;          suggested by Chris Poole
;; * 1.3: dired-details-toggle and customization support added by Klaus Berndl
;; * 1.2.4: Setup hide and show keybindings earlier than the first hide.
;; * 1.2.3: add dired-details-initially-hide customization as suggested by Harold Maier
;; * 1.2.2: extensive change to support subdirs in dired buffers
;; * 1.2.1: respect current hidden state (not initial state) when inserting subdirs

;;
;;  This enhances the functionality of library `dired-details.el'.
;;
;;
;;    NOTE: If you use Emacs 24.4 or later then you DO NOT NEED this
;;    library or library `dired-details.el'.  Instead, use
;;    `dired-hide-details-mode'.  Library `dired+.el' enhances
;;    `dired-hide-details-mode' to give it the save features as
;;    `dired-details+.el' provides.  Just use `(require 'dired+.el)'.
;;
;;
;;  `dired-details+.el' enhances `dired-details.el' in these ways:
;;
;;  1. It shrink-wraps Dired's frame whenever you show or hide
;;     details.  For this enhancement, you will need library
;;     `autofit-frame.el'.
;;
;;  2. It updates the listing whenever you create new files or
;;     directories or rename them.
;;
;;  3. It adds user option `dired-details-propagate-flag' which, if
;;     non-nil, propagates the last state you chose to the next Dired
;;     buffer you open.
;;
;;  4. It binds both `)' and `(' to `dired-details-toggle'.
;;
;;  Perhaps #2 corresponds to this TO-DO item in `dired-details.el':
;;
;;    * add a hook for dired-add-file to hide new entries as necessary
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `dired-details.el'
;;              has been REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `dired-details-activate' - If `dired-details-propagate-flag' is
;;                             non-nil, then use the last state.
;;
;;
;;  Put this in your initialization file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;   (require 'dired-details+)
;;
;;  I also recommend customizing `dired-details-hidden-string' to use
;;  the value \"\" instead of the default \"[...]\" - less wasted space.
;;
;;  Note: This library also calls `dired-details-install', activates
;;  show/hide and binds key `)'.

;;
;;  Hide/Show Details
;;  -----------------
;;
;;  Starting with Emacs 24.4, listing details are hidden by default.
;;  Use `(' anytime to toggle this hiding.  You can use option
;;  `diredp-hide-details-initially-flag' to change the default/initial
;;  state.  See also option `diredp-hide-details-propagate-flag'.
;;
;;  If you have an Emacs version older than 24.4, you can use library
;;  `dired-details+.el' (plus `dired-details.el') to get similar
;;  behavior.
;;
;;
;;  Fontification Level
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  If you want a maximum or minimum fontification for Dired mode,
;;  then customize option `font-lock-maximum-decoration'.  If you want
;;  a different fontification level for Dired than for other modes,
;;  you can do this too by customizing
;;  `font-lock-maximize-decoration'.
;;
;;
;;  Act on All Files
;;  ----------------
;;
;;  Most of the commands (such as `C' and `M-g') that operate on the
;;  marked files have the added feature here that multiple `C-u' use
;;  not the files that are marked or the next or previous N files, but
;;  *all* of the files in the Dired buffer.  Just what \"all\" files
;;  means changes with the number of `C-u', as follows:
;;
;;    `C-u C-u'         - Use all files present, but no directories.
;;    `C-u C-u C-u'     - Use all files and dirs except `.' and `..'.
;;    `C-u C-u C-u C-u' - use all files and dirs, `.' and `..'.
;;
;;    (More than four `C-u' act the same as two.)
;;
;;  This feature can be particularly useful when you have a Dired
;;  buffer with files chosen from multiple directories.
;;
;;  Note that this behavior is described only in the doc string of
;;  function `dired-get-marked-files'.  It is *not* described in the
;;  doc strings of the various commands, because that would require
;;  redefining each command separately here.  Instead, we redefine
;;  only macro `dired-map-over-marks' and function
;;  `dired-get-filename' in order to achieve this effect.
;;
;;
;;  Act on Marked (or All) Files Here and Below
;;  -------------------------------------------
;;
;;  The prefix argument behavior just described does not apply to the
;;  `diredp-*-recursive' commands.  These commands act on the marked
;;  files in the current Dired buffer or on all files in the directory
;;  if none are marked.
;;
;;  But these commands also handle marked subdirectories recursively,
;;  in the same way.  That is, they act also on the marked files in
;;  any marked subdirectories, found recursively.  If there is no
;;  Dired buffer for a given marked subdirectory then all of its files
;;  and subdirs are acted on.
;;
;;  With a prefix argument, all marks are ignored.  The commands act
;;  on all files in the current Dired buffer and all of its
;;  subdirectories, recursively.
;;
;;  All of the `diredp-*-recursive' commands are on prefix key `M-+',
;;  and they are available on submenu `Marked Here and Below' of the
;;  `Multiple' menu-bar menu.
;;
;;  If you use library `Icicles' then you have these additional
;;  commands/keys that act recursively on marked files.  They are in
;;  the `Icicles' submenu of menu `Multiple' > `Marked Here and
;;  Below'.
;;
;;  * `M-+ M-s M-s' or `M-s M-s m' - Use Icicles search (and its
;;                  on-demand replace) on the marked files.
;;
;;  * Save the names of the marked files:
;;
;;    `M-+ C-M->' - Save as a completion set, for use during
;;                  completion (e.g. with `C-x C-f').
;;
;;    `M-+ C->'   - Add marked names to the names in the current saved
;;                  completion set.
;;
;;    `M-+ C-}'   - Save persistently to an Icicles cache file, for
;;                  use during completion in another session.
;;
;;    `icicle-dired-save-marked-to-fileset-recursive' - Like `M-+
;;                  C-}', but save persistently to an Emacs fileset.
;;
;;    `M-+ C-M-}' - Save to a Lisp variable.
;;
;;
;;  In the other direction, if you have a saved set of file names then
;;  you can use `C-M-<' (`icicle-dired-chosen-files-other-window') in
;;  Dired to open a Dired buffer for just those files.  So you can
;;  mark some files and subdirs in a hierarchy of Dired buffers, use
;;  `M-+ C-}' to save their names persistently, then later use `C-{'
;;  to retrieve them, and `C-M-<' (in Dired) to open Dired on them.
;;
;;
;;  Wraparound Navigation
;;  ---------------------
;;
;;  In vanilla Dired, `dired-next-marked-file' (`M-}' or `* C-n') and
;;  `dired-previous-marked-file' (`M-{' or `* C-p') wrap around when
;;  you get to the end or the beginning of the Dired buffer.  Handy.
;;
;;  But the other navigation commands do not wrap around.  In Dired+
;;  they do, provided option `diredp-wrap-around-flag' is non-nil,
;;  which it is by default.  This means the following commands:
;;
;;    `diredp-next-line'     - `n', `C-n', `down', `SPC'
;;    `diredp-previous-line' - `p', `C-p', `up'
;;    `diredp-next-dirline'  - `>'
;;    `diredp-prev-dirline'  - `<'
;;    `diredp-next-subdir'   - `C-M-n'
;;    `diredp-prev-subdir'   - `C-M-p'
;;
;;
;;  Inserted Subdirs, Multiple Dired Buffers, Files from Anywhere,...
;;  -----------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  These two standard Dired features are worth pointing out:
;;
;;  * You can insert multiple subdirectory listings into a single
;;    Dired buffer using `i' on each subdir line.  Use `C-u i' to
;;    specify `ls' switches.  Specifying switch `R' inserts the
;;    inserted subdirectory's subdirs also, recursively.  You can also
;;    use `i' to bounce between a subdirectory line and its
;;    inserted-listing header line.  You can delete a subdir listing
;;    using `C-u k' on its header line.  You can hide/show an inserted
;;    subdir using `$' and `M-$'.  You can use `C-_' to undo any of
;;    these operations.
;;
;;  * You can open a Dired buffer for an arbitrary set of files, from
;;    different directories.
;;
;;    First, you can pass a glob pattern with wildcards to `dired'
;;    interactively, as the file name.
;;
;;    Beyond that, you can invoke `dired' non-interactively, passing
;;    it a cons of buffer name and file names.  Relative file names
;;    are interpreted relative to the value of `default-directory'.
;;    Use absolute file names if appropriate.
;;
;;  Some other libraries, such as `Bookmark+' and `Icicles', make it
;;  easy to create or re-create Dired buffers that list specific files
;;  and have a particular set of markings.  This can be handy for
;;  using Dired buffers to manage projects.  In such use cases you
;;  might have multiple Dired buffers that have quite specific
;;  contents and that you want to keep around during a session.
;;
;;  This is one motivation for the Dired+ `diredp-*-recursive'
;;  commands, which act on the marked files in marked subdirectories,
;;  recursively.  In one sense, these commands are an alternative to
;;  using a single Dired buffer with inserted subdirectories.  They
;;  let you use the same operations on the files in a set of Dired
;;  directories, without inserting those directories into an ancestor
;;  Dired buffer.

;;  So you might have some subdirectories inserted in the same Dired
;;  buffer, and you might have separate Dired buffers for some
;;  subdirectories.  Sometimes it is useful to have both for the same
;;  subdirectory.  And sometimes it is useful to move from one
;;  presentation to the other.
;;
;;  You can use command `diredp-dired-inserted-subdirs' to open a
;;  separate Dired buffer for each of the subdirs that is inserted in
;;  the current Dired buffer.  Markings and Dired switches are
;;  preserved.
;;
;;  In the opposite direction, if you use `Icicles' then you can use
;;  multi-command `icicle-dired-insert-as-subdir', which lets you
;;  insert any number of directories you choose interactively into a
;;  Dired ancestor directory listing.  If a directory you choose to
;;  insert already has its own Dired buffer, then its markings and
;;  switches are preserved for the new, subdirectory listing in the
;;  ancestor Dired buffer.

"]) (diminish . [(20091203 1012) nil "Diminished modes are minor modes with no modeline display" single ";;; Commentary:

;; Minor modes each put a word on the mode line to signify that they're
;; active.  This can cause other displays, such as % of file that point is
;; at, to run off the right side of the screen.  For some minor modes, such
;; as mouse-avoidance-mode, the display is a waste of space, since users
;; typically set the mode in their .emacs & never change it.  For other
;; modes, such as my jiggle-mode, it's a waste because there's already a
;; visual indication of whether the mode is in effect.

;; A diminished mode is a minor mode that has had its mode line
;; display diminished, usually to nothing, although diminishing to a
;; shorter word or a single letter is also supported.  This package
;; implements diminished modes.

;; You can use this package either interactively or from your .emacs file.
;; In either case, first you'll need to copy this file to a directory that
;; appears in your load-path.  `load-path' is the name of a variable that
;; contains a list of directories Emacs searches for files to load.
;; To prepend another directory to load-path, put a line like
;; (add-to-list 'load-path \"c:/My_Directory\") in your .emacs file.

;; To create diminished modes interactively, type
;;   M-x load-library
;; to get a prompt like
;;   Load library:
;; and respond `diminish' (unquoted).  Then type
;;   M-x diminish
;; to get a prompt like
;;   Diminish what minor mode:
;; and respond with the name of some minor mode, like mouse-avoidance-mode.
;; You'll then get this prompt:
;;   To what mode-line display:
;; Respond by just hitting <Enter> if you want the name of the mode
;; completely removed from the mode line.  If you prefer, you can abbreviate
;; the name.  If your abbreviation is 2 characters or more, such as \"Av\",
;; it'll be displayed as a separate word on the mode line, just like minor
;; modes' names.  If it's a single character, such as \"V\", it'll be scrunched
;; up against the previous word, so for example if the undiminished mode line
;; display had been \"Abbrev Fill Avoid\", it would become \"Abbrev FillV\".
;; Multiple single-letter diminished modes will all be scrunched together.
;; The display of undiminished modes will not be affected.

;; To find out what the mode line would look like if all diminished modes
;; were still minor, type M-x diminished-modes.  This displays in the echo
;; area the complete list of minor or diminished modes now active, but
;; displays them all as minor.  They remain diminished on the mode line.

;; To convert a diminished mode back to a minor mode, type M-x diminish-undo
;; to get a prompt like
;;   Restore what diminished mode:
;; Respond with the name of some diminished mode.  To convert all
;; diminished modes back to minor modes, respond to that prompt
;; with `diminished-modes' (unquoted, & note the hyphen).

;; When you're responding to the prompts for mode names, you can use
;; completion to avoid extra typing; for example, m o u SPC SPC SPC
;; is usually enough to specify mouse-avoidance-mode.  Mode names
;; typically end in \"-mode\", but for historical reasons
;; auto-fill-mode is named by \"auto-fill-function\".

;; To create diminished modes noninteractively in your .emacs file, put
;; code like
;;   (require 'diminish)
;;   (diminish 'abbrev-mode \"Abv\")
;;   (diminish 'jiggle-mode)
;;   (diminish 'mouse-avoidance-mode \"M\")
;; near the end of your .emacs file.  It should be near the end so that any
;; minor modes your .emacs loads will already have been loaded by the time
;; they're to be converted to diminished modes.

;; To diminish a major mode, (setq mode-name \"whatever\") in the mode hook.

;; identical.

;; If FROM and TO are not identical, the function preserves the
;; balance between the two characters: For each FROM that is
;; encountered while looking for TO, one additional TO is required;
;; and vice versa. For example, in \"{ foo X{bar} baz }\", with X being
;; point and \"{\" and \"}\" as delimiters, the text \"{ foo {bar} baz }\"
;; will be killed, not \"{ foo {bar}\".

;; delim-kill is useful in programming and in editing other files with
;; structure, such as CSV or JSON. In C-style langiuages, for
;; instance, you can use it to easily kill the {}-delimited block you
;; are currently in. In a CSV file you might kill the current field,
;; regardless of where point is.

;; delim-kill was inspired by Damian Conway's course \"The productive
;; programmer\". Thanks!

;;; Dependencies: none.

;;; Installation:
;; Put the file anywhere in your load path, (require 'delim-kill), and
;; bind the function to a key.

;; Deft is an Emacs mode for quickly browsing, filtering, and editing
;; directories of plain text notes, inspired by Notational Velocity.
;; It was designed for increased productivity when writing and taking
;; notes by making it fast and simple to find the right file at the
;; right time and by automating many of the usual tasks such as
;; creating new files and saving files.

;; Deft is open source software and may be freely distributed and
;; modified under the BSD license.  Version 0.5.1 is the latest stable
;; version, released on January 28, 2013.  You may download it
;; directly here:

;;   * [deft.el](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/deft.el)

;; To follow or contribute to Deft development, you can either
;; [browse](http://jblevins.org/git/deft.git) or clone the Git
;; repository:

;;     git clone git://jblevins.org/git/deft.git

;; ![File Browser](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/browser.png)

;; The Deft buffer is simply a file browser which lists the titles of
;; all text files in the Deft directory followed by short summaries
;; and last modified times.  The title is taken to be the first line
;; of the file and the summary is extracted from the text that
;; follows.  Files are sorted in terms of the last modified date, from
;; newest to oldest.

;; All Deft files or notes are simple plain text files where the first
;; line contains a title.  As an example, the following directory
;; structure generated the screenshot above.
;;
;;     % ls ~/.deft
;;     about.txt    browser.txt     directory.txt   operations.txt
;;     ack.txt      completion.txt  extensions.txt  text-mode.txt
;;     binding.txt  creation.txt    filtering.txt
;;
;;     % cat ~/.deft/about.txt

;;
;;     An Emacs mode for slicing and dicing plain text files.

;; ![Filtering](http://jblevins.org/projects/deft/filter.png)

;; Deft's primary operation is searching and filtering.  The list of
;; files can be limited or filtered using a search string, which will
;; match both the title and the body text.  To initiate a filter,
;; simply start typing.  Filtering happens on the fly.  As you type,
;; the file browser is updated to include only files that match the
;; current string.

;; To open the first matching file, simply press `RET`.  If no files
;; match your search string, pressing `RET` will create a new file
;; using the string as the title.  This is a very fast way to start
;; writing new notes.  The filename will be generated automatically.
;; If you prefer to provide a specific filename, use `C-RET` instead.

;; To open files other than the first match, navigate up and down
;; using `C-p` and `C-n` and press `RET` on the file you want to open.
;; When opening a file, Deft searches forward and leaves the point
;; at the end of the first match of the filter string.

;; You can also press `C-o` to open a file in another window, without
;; switching to the other window.  Issue the same command with a prefix
;; argument, `C-u C-o`, to open the file in another window and switch
;; to that window.

;; To edit the filter string, press `DEL` (backspace) to remove the
;; last character or `M-DEL` to remove the last \"word\".  To yank
;; (paste) the most recently killed (cut or copied) text into the
;; filter string, press `C-y`.  Press `C-c C-c` to clear the filter
;; string and display all files and `C-c C-g` to refresh the file
;; browser using the current filter string.

;; For more advanced editing operations, you can also edit the filter
;; string in the minibuffer by pressing `C-c C-l`.  While in the
;; minibuffer, the history of previous edits can be cycled through by
;; pressing `M-p` and `M-n`.  This form of static, one-time filtering
;; (as opposed to incremental, on-the-fly filtering) may be preferable
;; in some situations, such as over slow connections or on systems
;; where interactive filtering performance is poor.

;; By default, Deft filters files in incremental string search mode,
;; where \"search string\" will match all files containing both \"search\"
;; and \"string\" in any order.  Alternatively, Deft supports direct
;; regexp filtering, where the filter string is interpreted as a
;; formal regular expression.  For example, `^\\(foo\\|bar\\)` matches
;; foo or bar at the beginning of a line.  Pressing `C-c C-t` will
;; toggle between incremental and regexp search modes.  Regexp
;; search mode is indicated by an \"R\" in the mode line.

;; Common file operations can also be carried out from within Deft.
;; Files can be renamed using `C-c C-r` or deleted using `C-c C-d`.
;; New files can also be created using `C-c C-n` for quick creation or
;; `C-c C-m` for a filename prompt.  You can leave Deft at any time
;; with `C-c C-q`.

;; Archiving unused files can be carried out by pressing `C-c C-a`.
;; Files will be moved to `deft-archive-directory', which is a
;; directory named `archive` within your `deft-directory' by default.

;; Files opened with deft are automatically saved after Emacs has been
;; idle for a customizable number of seconds.  This value is a floating
;; point number given by `deft-auto-save-interval' (default: 1.0).

;; Getting Started
;; ---------------

;; To start using it, place it somewhere in your Emacs load-path and
;; add the line

;;     (require 'deft)

;; in your `.emacs` file.  Then run `M-x deft` to start.  It is useful
;; to create a global keybinding for the `deft` function (e.g., a
;; function key) to start it quickly (see below for details).

;; When you first run Deft, it will complain that it cannot find the
;; `~/.deft` directory.  You can either create a symbolic link to
;; another directory where you keep your notes or run `M-x deft-setup`
;; to create the `~/.deft` directory automatically.

;; One useful way to use Deft is to keep a directory of notes in a
;; Dropbox folder.  This can be used with other applications and
;; mobile devices, for example, Notational Velocity or Simplenote
;; on OS X, Elements on iOS, or Epistle on Android.

;; Customization
;; -------------

;; Customize the `deft` group to change the functionality.

;; By default, Deft looks for notes by searching for files with the
;; extension `.txt` in the `~/.deft` directory.  You can customize
;; both the file extension and the Deft directory by running
;; `M-x customize-group` and typing `deft`.  Alternatively, you can
;; configure them in your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-extension \"txt\")
;;     (setq deft-directory \"~/Dropbox/notes\")

;; You can also customize the major mode that Deft uses to edit files,
;; either through `M-x customize-group` or by adding something like
;; the following to your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-text-mode 'markdown-mode)

;; Note that the mode need not be a traditional text mode.  If you
;; prefer to write notes as LaTeX fragments, for example, you could
;; set `deft-extension' to \"tex\" and `deft-text-mode' to `latex-mode'.

;; If you prefer `org-mode', then simply use

;;     (setq deft-extension \"org\")
;;     (setq deft-text-mode 'org-mode)

;; For compatibility with other applications which take the title from
;; the filename, rather than from first line of the file, set the
;; `deft-use-filename-as-title' flag to a non-nil value.  This also
;; changes the default behavior for creating new files when the filter
;; is non-empty: the filter string will be used as the new filename
;; rather than inserted into the new file.  To enable this
;; functionality, simply add the following to your `.emacs` file:

;;     (setq deft-use-filename-as-title t)

;; You can easily set up a global keyboard binding for Deft.  For
;; example, to bind it to F8, add the following code to your `.emacs`
;; file:

;;     (global-set-key [f8] 'deft)

;; Deft also provides a function for opening files without using the
;; Deft buffer directly.  Calling `deft-find-file' will prompt for a
;; file to open, just like `find-file', but starting from
;; `deft-directory'.  If the file selected is in `deft-directory', it
;; is opened with the usual deft features (using `deft-text-mode',
;; automatic saving, automatic updating of the Deft buffer, etc.).
;; Otherwise, the file will be opened by `find-file' as usual.
;; Therefore, you can set up a global keybinding for this function to
;; open Deft files anywhere.  For example, to use `C-x C-g`, a
;; neighbor of `C-x C-f`, use the following:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"C-x C-g\") 'deft-find-file)

;; The faces used for highlighting various parts of the screen can
;; also be customized.  By default, these faces inherit their
;; properties from the standard font-lock faces defined by your current
;; color theme.

;; Incremental string search is the default method of filtering on
;; startup, but you can set `deft-incremental-search' to nil to make
;; regexp search the default.

;; The title of each file is taken to be the first line of the file,
;; with certain characters removed from the beginning (hash
;; characters, as used in Markdown headers, and asterisks, as in Org
;; Mode headers).  The substrings to remove are specified in
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp'.

;; More generally, the title post-processing function itself can be
;; customized by setting `deft-parse-title-function', which accepts
;; the first line of the file as an argument and returns the parsed
;; title to display in the file browser.  The default function is
;; `deft-strip-title', which removes all occurrences of
;; `deft-strip-title-regexp' as described above.

;; Acknowledgments
;; ---------------

;; Thanks to Konstantinos Efstathiou for writing simplnote.el, from
;; which I borrowed liberally, and to Zachary Schneirov for writing
;; Notational Velocity, whose functionality and spirit I wanted to
;; bring to Emacs.

;; History
;; -------

;; Version 0.5.1 (2013-01-28):

;; * Bug fix: creating files with `C-c C-n` when both the filter string and
;;   `deft-use-filename-as-title' are non-nil resulted in an invalid path.
;; * Bug fix: killed buffers would persist in `deft-auto-save-buffers'.

;; Version 0.5 (2013-01-25):

;; * Implement incremental string search (default) and regex search.
;;   These search modes can be toggled by pressing `C-c C-t`.
;; * Default search method can be changed by setting `deft-incremental-search'.
;; * Support custom `deft-parse-title-function' for post-processing titles.
;; * The default `deft-parse-title-function' simply strips occurrences of
;;   `deft-strip-title-regexp', which removes Markdown and Org headings.
;; * Open files in another window with `C-o`.  Prefix it with `C-u` to
;;   switch to the other window.
;; * For symbolic links, use modification time of taget for sorting.
;; * When opening files, move point to the end of the first match of
;;   the filter string.
;; * Improved filter editing: delete (`DEL`), delete word (`M-DEL`),
;;   and yank (`C-y`).
;; * Advanced filter editing in minibuffer (`C-c C-l`).

;; Version 0.4 (2011-12-11):

;; * Improved filtering performance.
;; * Optionally take title from filename instead of first line of the
;;   contents (see `deft-use-filename-as-title').
;; * Dynamically resize width to fit the entire window.
;; * Customizable time format (see `deft-time-format').
;; * Handle `deft-directory' properly with or without a trailing slash.

;; Version 0.3 (2011-09-11):

;; * Internationalization: support filtering with multibyte characters.

;; Version 0.2 (2011-08-22):

;; * Match filenames when filtering.
;; * Automatically save opened files (optional).
;; * Address some byte-compilation warnings.

;; Deft was originally written by [Jason Blevins](http://jblevins.org/).
;; The initial version, 0.1, was released on August 6, 2011.

;; This program provides a nice ``printf debugging'' environment by

;; For example, if you want to observe the variable `foo' in the expression
;;   (let ((foo (something-with-side-effect)
;;         (bar (something-depends-on foo))
;;     ...)
;; you have to use frustrating idiom:
;;   (let ((foo (progn
;;                (let ((tmp (something-with-side-effect)))
;;                  (message \"%s\" tmp)
;;                  tmp)))
;;         (bar (something-depends-on foo))
;;     ...)
;; (In this case one can use `let*' but it is an example.) This program
;; allows you to write as follows:
;;   (let ((foo ::?= (something-with-side-effect)
;;         (bar (something-depends-oidn foo))
;;     ...)
;; After rewrite, move point to the last of expression as usual, and do
;; `debug-print-eval-last-sexp'. It is the same as `eval-last-sexp' except rewrite
;; the read expression recursively as follows:
;;   ... ::?= expr ...
;;     => ... (debug-print expr) ...
;; Here `debug-print' is a macro, which does that the above frustrating idiom does.
;; (Note that this needs initialization.) For who kwons Gauche note that it is
;; not implemented by reader macro. So one have to use some settings to inform
;; emacs that the expression needs preprocessed.
;;
;; Initialization and configuration: To use the above feature, write as follows
;; in your .emacs.d/init.el (after setting of load-path):
;;   (require 'debug-print)
;;   (debug-print-init)

;;
;; Enhancements to `cus-edit.el'.
;;
;;  Terminology
;;  -----------
;;
;;  Most of the enhancements here basically try to make Customize play
;;  a little better with Emacs.  Customize deals with user
;;  preferences, which are faces and variables.  User variables are
;;  also called \"user options\"; they are defined by `user-variable-p'.
;;  All faces are user preferences.
;;
;;  Note: The Customize source code sometimes refers to both faces and
;;  user variables (what I am calling \"user preferences\") as \"user
;;  options\".  The latter term has traditionally been used in Emacs for
;;  user variables only.
;;
;;  Contents
;;  --------
;;
;;  The enhancements to standard library `cus-edit.el' provided by
;;  `cus-edit+.el' include miscellaneous enhancements, such as
;;  formatting the Customize buffer better, and enhancements to make
;;  Customize play better with the rest of Emacs.  Most of the
;;  description here is about the latter.
;;
;;  Customizing Options of a Particular Type
;;  ----------------------------------------
;;
;;  Command `customize-apropos-options-of-type' is similar to the
;;  standard command `customize-apropos-options', but it also lets you
;;  specify the type of the options to find.
;;
;;  To use `customize-apropos-options-of-type', you specify a
;;  `defcustom' type and a regexp.  The command opens a Customize
;;  buffer for all options that are defined with the specified type
;;  and whose names match the specified regexp.
;;
;;  With a prefix argument, the matching options need not be defined
;;  with exactly the same `defcustom' type.  They need only have their
;;  current value be compatible with the type you specify.
;;
;;  Enhancements to Make Customize Play Better with Emacs
;;  -----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There are various ways to change preferences outside of Customize,
;;  and Customize unfortunately doesn't recognize these changes as
;;  preference settings - it considers them to be \"changed outside the
;;  customize buffer\", which really means that it just throws up its
;;  hands.
;;
;;  The main idea here is to let Customize know about changes made
;;  outside it, to make Customize think that they were made inside
;;  Customize.  In this way, there is no such outside/inside
;;  distinction (for user preferences), and it doesn't matter where or
;;  how a preference is changed.
;;
;;  When this is the case, you can use command `customize-unsaved' to
;;  check all preferences that have been changed from their standard
;;  or saved settings, and it will take all changes into account, no
;;  matter how or where the changes were made.
;;
;;  Because this is useful, `customize-unsaved' has been modified to
;;  be used as a hook in `kill-emacs-query-functions'.  That way,
;;  before you quit Emacs, you are notified of all preference changes
;;  you have made and given a chance to save them (individually or
;;  collectively).  This is analogous to Emacs asking you about files
;;  you've changed but not saved, before letting you exit. (If you
;;  also use another hook to confirm exit from Emacs, then `C-x C-c'
;;  becomes, in effect, a key binding for `customize-unsaved' - just
;;  say `n' to exiting Emacs.)
;;
;;  Updating Customize with External Changes
;;  ----------------------------------------
;;
;;  In order to keep Customize synched with changes made outside it,
;;  command `customize-update-all' can be used automatically during
;;  idle moments to tell Customize that all user options and faces
;;  that have been changed outside it are now set - just as if they
;;  were set in Customize.  You can turn this automatic updating on
;;  and off with command `customize-toggle-outside-change-updates'.
;;
;;  Read This If You Use Frame-Specific Faces
;;  -----------------------------------------
;;
;;  The automatic updating that you turn on (or off) with
;;  `customize-toggle-outside-change-updates' uses internal variable
;;  `custom-update-timer' to periodically run command
;;  `customize-update-all'.  That command in turn uses commands
;;  `customize-update-all-vars' to update variables and
;;  `customize-update-all-faces' to updated faces.  It thus updates
;;  Customize with respect to face changes as well as variable
;;  changes.
;;
;;  Unlike user options (variables), faces can be specific to
;;  individual frames.  The face updating code used here assumes that
;;  you do not use different versions of a face on different frames,
;;  that, for example, face `foo' has the same attributes on all
;;  frames.  If that is not the way you use faces and frames, then you
;;  might not want to automatically update Customize to recognize face
;;  changes made outside Customize.  In that case, change the value of
;;  `custom-update-timer' in your init file (~/.emacs) to use
;;  `customize-update-all-vars' instead of `customize-update-all':
;;
;;  (defvar custom-update-timer
;;    (run-with-idle-timer custom-check-for-changes-interval
;;                         t 'customize-update-all-vars) ; <======
;;    \"Timer used to automatically tell Customize of outside changes
;;  to preferences when idle.\")
;;
;;  The automatic face updating works like this: The current-frame
;;  definition of each face is compared with the face's definition
;;  according to Customize.  If these are different, then the
;;  Customize definition is updated to the current-frame definition.
;;  Since there is no way to know which frame will be current when
;;  updating takes place, if you 1) use automatic updating and 2) use
;;  different definitions of a given face on different frames, then
;;  you probably do not want to update faces automatically.
;;
;;  Dealing with Spurious Changes, 1: Save
;;  --------------------------------------
;;
;;  Even if you don't change any preferences yourself, when you quit
;;  Emacs the first time you are informed that there are lots of
;;  changed preferences, and you are given a chance to save those
;;  changes.  What are those changes? They represent all of the user
;;  preferences that Emacs and various Emacs libraries have changed
;;  behind Customize's back - even before you did anything.
;;
;;  You'll see user options like `baud-rate' that are set in Emacs C
;;  code without informing Customize to mark their settings as
;;  `standard' (= installed).  There shouldn't be any such apparent
;;  \"changes\", since this is part of standard Emacs, but that's the
;;  way it is, for now.  Customize is still fairly new, and lots of
;;  Emacs libraries still define and change user preferences without
;;  going through Customize and, in effect, telling it not to consider
;;  such preference changes as changes.
;;
;;  If you choose to save these preference changes, you will never
;;  again be bothered by being informed that they have changed (unless
;;  you change them).  So, that's one solution to this bother, which
;;  makes it a one-time only nuisance: just say \"save all\".
;;
;;  Dealing with Spurious Changes, 2: Ignore
;;  ----------------------------------------
;;
;;  Another solution is also possible.  Some user preferences, like
;;  `case-fold-search' and `debug-on-error' are really the kind of
;;  thing that you change often and temporarily - you don't really
;;  care about saving their changes, and you certainly don't want to
;;  be asked whether or not you want to save them each you quit Emacs.
;;
;;  To deal with that, a list of ignored preferences,
;;  `customize-customized-ignore', is defined here.  Its preferences
;;  (symbols) are not used by `customize-unsaved' at all (you can
;;  override that interactively with a prefix arg).  So, the other way
;;  to deal with the legacy Emacs preferences, besides just saving
;;  them in your custom file, is to add them to
;;  `customize-customized-ignore' so `customize-unsaved' will ignore
;;  them.
;;
;;  To make it easy for you to add preferences to this ignore list,
;;  `Ignore Unsaved Changes' menu items and buttons have been added.
;;  You can choose to ignore specific preferences or all preferences
;;  in a Customize buffer - in particular, all preferences in the
;;  Customize buffer from `customize-unsaved' (all changed
;;  preferences).
;;
;;  Dealing with Spurious Changes, 3: Consider Unchanged
;;  ----------------------------------------------------
;;
;;  There is also a third way to treat preference changes that you are
;;  not responsible for, as an alternative to saving them to your
;;  custom file or having Customize always ignore them: tell Customize
;;  to consider the current changes as unchanged.  This essentially
;;  treats them as having been saved, but without saving them.  You can
;;  do this using the `Consider Unchanged' menu items and buttons
;;  added here.
;;
;;  For instance, after starting Emacs, you can examine the current
;;  preference changes (using `customize-unsaved') from Emacs itself
;;  and loaded libraries, and choose `Consider Unchanged' to let
;;  Customize know that the current values are to be treated as if
;;  they were saved, but without actually saving them to your custom
;;  file.  That way, your custom file is not polluted with things that
;;  you are not really concerned with, yet you are not bothered by
;;  seeing such fictitious changes show up each time you check for
;;  changes.
;;
;;  However, unlike ignoring changes to certain preferences, and
;;  really saving current preference values, `Consider Unchanged' is
;;  not a persistent change.  You can use it at any time to \"reset\"
;;  the change counter for given preferences, so that the current
;;  change is considered the new base value (as if it were saved), and
;;  any further changes you make to them will show up as changes,
;;  using `customize-unsaved'.
;;
;;  Updating, Revisited
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  Finally, there is one more additional menu item and button
;;  provided here, `Set from External Changes', which just executes
;;  the appropriate `customize-update-all*' command (depending on the
;;  menu/button location).  It is useful if you do not choose to use
;;  automatic updating of preferences that are changed outside of
;;  Customize.
;;
;;  Conclusion & Future
;;  -------------------
;;
;;  The changes in Customize behavior provided by this library are
;;  important, because they can encourage library authors to explore
;;  other ways of changing preference values, and still let users save
;;  the changes using Customize.  For instance in my library
;;  `doremi-frm.el' I have defined several commands that let you
;;  directly manipulate frame and face properties (e.g. incremental
;;  color changes).
;;
;;  By making Customize aware of such \"outside\" changes, you can
;;  easily save them in Customize.  There are lots of preferences that
;;  would be amenable to such \"direct-manipulation\", which I think
;;  would be an improvement in ease of customization.
;;
;;  In sum, this library in effect gets rid of the useless \"changed
;;  outside Customize\" state.  User preferences have only the
;;  `standard', `saved', or `set' (= unsaved) state, regardless of how
;;  they are set.  Someday, Customize will be more integrated with the
;;  rest of Emacs, and \"changed outside Customize\" will make no more
;;  sense than \"changed outside of Emacs\".  Customize will then be
;;  just one possible way to access the space of user preferences, the
;;  same preference space that other parts of Emacs can access
;;  differently.  If we're writing on the same blackboard, you can see
;;  what I erase, and I can see what you write.
;;
;;  That's the goal.  This tries to be a step on the way.
;;
;;  How To Use
;;  ----------
;;
;;  To use this library, put this in your init file (.emacs):
;;
;;    (require cus-edit+)
;;
;;  To update Customize once, manually, so that it learns about stuff
;;  that was customized outside it, use any of these commands:
;;  `customize-update-all-faces', `customize-update-all-vars',
;;  `customize-update-all' (which is both faces and variables).
;;
;;  To do the same updating automatically, add this to your init file
;;  (automatic updating is off by default):
;;
;;    (customize-toggle-outside-change-updates 99)
;;
;;  To turn automatic updating on/off, use command
;;  `customize-toggle-outside-change-updates'.
;;
;;  To change the number of idle seconds before automatically updating
;;  Customize, use command `customize-set-auto-update-timer-period'.
;;
;;  To *not* have `customize-unsaved' check for unsaved preference
;;  changes when you quit Emacs, add this also:
;;
;;    (remove-hook 'kill-emacs-query-functions 'customize-unsaved)
;;
;;
;;

;;
;;  This library provides three kinds of changes to the text cursor:
;;
;;  1. When a buffer is read-only or is in overwrite mode, the cursor
;;     type changes to `curchg-overwrite/read-only-cursor-type'.  This
;;     is controlled by command `change-cursor-mode' and user option
;;     `curchg-change-cursor-on-overwrite/read-only-flag'.
;;
;;  2. When an input method is in use, the cursor color changes to
;;     `curchg-input-method-cursor-color'.  This is controlled by
;;     command `change-cursor-mode' and user option
;;     `curchg-change-cursor-on-input-method-flag'.
;;
;;  3. When Emacs is idle, the cursor type changes to
;;     `curchg-idle-cursor-type'.  This is controlled by command
;;     `toggle-cursor-type-when-idle'.
;;
;;  To turn on all three types of cursor change by default, put the

;;  `oneonone.el', then do NOT also use library `cursor-chg.el'.
;;
;;  Note for Emacs 20: There is a bug in Emacs 20 which can lead to a
;;  fatal error (Emacs crash) when using `query-replace' with
;;  idle-cursor change enabled.  If you use Emacs 20, then consider

;;
;;   - automagic code-doc generation when you type three slashes.
;;
;;   - intelligent insertion of matched pairs of curly braces.
;;
;;   - compile tweaks. Infers the compile command from special comments
;;     in the file header.  Also, sets the regex for next-error, so that

;;       - infer flymake command otherwise (presence of makefile, etc)
;;       - Turn off query-on-exit-flag for the flymake process.
;;       - define advice to flymake-goto-line , to allow it to goto the
;;         appropriate column for the error on a given line. This works
;;         with `flymake-goto-next-error' etc.
;;
;;   - yasnippet integration

;; Installation instructions
;; --------------------------------
;;
;; Put csharp-mode.el somewhere in your load path, optionally byte-compile
;; it, and add the following to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'csharp-mode \"csharp-mode\" \"Major mode for editing C# code.\" t)
;;   (setq auto-mode-alist
;;      (append '((\"\\\\.cs$\" . csharp-mode)) auto-mode-alist))
;;
;;
;; Optionally, define and register a mode-hook function. To do so, use
;; something like this in your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (defun my-csharp-mode-fn ()
;;      \"function that runs when csharp-mode is initialized for a buffer.\"
;;      (turn-on-auto-revert-mode)
;;      (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
;;      (require 'flymake)
;;      (flymake-mode 1)
;;      (require 'yasnippet)
;;      (yas/minor-mode-on)
;;      (require 'rfringe)
;;      ...insert more code here...
;;      ...including any custom key bindings you might want ...
;;   )
;;   (add-hook  'csharp-mode-hook 'my-csharp-mode-fn t)
;;
;;
;;  General
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  Mostly C# mode will \"just work.\"  Use `describe-mode' to see the
;;  default keybindings and the highlights of the mode.
;;
;;
;;  Flymake Integration
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  You can use flymake with csharp mode to automatically check the
;;  syntax of your csharp code, and highlight errors.  To do so, add a
;;  comment line like this to each .cs file that you use flymake with:
;;
;;   //  flymake: c:\\.net3.5\\csc.exe /t:module /nologo /R:Foo.dll @@FILE@@
;;
;;  That lines specifies a command \"stub\".  Flymake appends the name of
;;  the file to compile, and then runs the command to check
;;  syntax. Flymake assumes that syntax errors will be noted in the
;;  output of the command in a form that fits one of the regexs in the
;;  `compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist'. Check the flymake module for
;;  more information on that.
;;
;;  Some rules for the command:
;;
;;    1. it must appear all on a single line.
;;
;;    2. csharp-mode generally looks for the marker line in the first N
;;       lines of the file, where N is set in
;;       `csharp-cmd-line-limit'.  See the documentation on that
;;       variable for more information.
;;
;;    3. the command SHOULD use @@FILE@@ in place of the name of the
;;       source file to be compiled, normally the file being edited.
;;       This is because normally flymake saves a copy of the buffer
;;       into a temporary file with a unique name, and then compiles
;;       that temporary file. The token @@FILE@@ is replaced by
;;       csharp-mode with the name of the temporary file created by
;;       flymake, before invoking the command.
;;
;;    4. The command should include /R options specifying external
;;       libraries that the code depends on.
;;
;;  If you have no external dependencies, then you need not specify any
;;  flymake command at all. csharp-mode will implicitly act as if you had
;;  specified the command:
;;
;;      // flymake: c:\\.net3.5\\csc.exe /t:module /nologo @@FILE@@
;;
;;
;;  If you use csc.exe as the syntax check tool (as almost everyone
;;  will), the /t:module is important. csharp-mode assumes that the
;;  syntax-check compile command will produce a file named
;;  NAME.netmodule, which is the default when using /t:module. (Remember
;;  than NAME is dynamically generated).  csharp-mode will remove the
;;  generated netmodule file after the syntax check is complete. If you
;;  don't specify /t:module, then csharp-mode won't know what file to
;;  delete.
;;
;;  csharp-mode also fiddles with some other flymake things.  In
;;  particular it: adds .cs to the flymake \"allowed filename masks\";
;;  adds parsing for csc error messages; and adds advice to the error
;;  parsing logic. This all should be pretty benign for all other
;;  flymake buffers.  But it might not be.
;;
;;  You can explicitly turn the flymake integration for C# off by
;;  setting `csharp-want-flymake-fixup' to nil.
;;
;;
;;  Compile Integration
;;  ----------------------------
;;
;;  csharp-mode binds the function `csharp-invoke-compile-interactively'
;;  to \"\\C-x\\C-e\" .  This function attempts to intellgently guess the
;;  format of the compile command to use for a buffer.  It looks in the
;;  comments at the head of the buffer for a line that begins with
;;  compile: .  If found, csharp-mode suggests the text that follows as
;;  the compilation command when running `compile' .  If such a line is
;;  not found, csharp-mode falls back to a msbuild or nmake command.
;;  See the documentation on `csharp-cmd-line-limit' for further
;;  information.
;;
;;  Also, csharp-mode installs an error regexp for csc.exe into
;;  `compilation-error-regexp-alist-alist', which allows `next-error'
;;  and `previous-error' (defined in compile.el) to navigate to the next
;;  and previous compile errors in the cs buffer, after you've run `compile'.
;;
;;
;;  YASnippet integration
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  csharp-mode defines some built-in snippets for
;;  convenience.  For example, if statements, for, foreach, and
;;  so on.  You can see them on the YASnippet menu that is displayed
;;  when a csharp-mode buffer is opened.  csharp-mode defines this
;;  snippets happens only if ya-snippet is available. (It is done in an
;;  `eval-after-load' clause.)  The builtin snippets will not overwrite
;;  snippets that use the same name, if they are defined in the normal
;;  way (in a compiled bundle) with ya-snippet.
;;
;;  You can explicitly turn off ya-snippet integration. See the var,
;;  `csharp-want-yasnippet-fixup'.
;;
;;
;;  imenu integration
;;  -----------------------------
;;
;;  This should just work. For those who don't know what imenu is, it
;;  allows navigation to different points within the file from an
;;  \"Index\" menu, in the window's menubar.  csharp-mode computes the
;;  menu containing the namespaces, classes, methods, and so on, in the
;;  buffer.  This happens at the time the file is loaded; for large
;;  files it takes a bit of time to complete the scan.  If you don't
;;  want this capability, set `csharp-want-imenu' to nil.

;; DOWNLOADING
;;
;; This module is available at Google Code:
;;
;;   http://code.google.com/p/confluence-el/
;;
;; INSTALLATION 
;;
;; You must set confluence-url in your .emacs file before using the functions
;; in this module.  It's best to place confluence.el and confluence-edit.el
;; and xml-rpc.el on your load path; often ~/.emacs.d or ~/elisp.
;;
;; Some examples:
;;
;;   ;; loading xml-rpc.el may not be necessary, it depends on your
;;   ;; installed version of Emacs, it was necessary on 22.1.1.
;;   ;; Both xml-rpc.el and confluence.el should be on your load-path.
;;
;;   (require 'confluence)
;;   (setq confluence-url \"http://intranet/confluence/rpc/xmlrpc\")
;;
;; There are various additional customzation options.  These can be explored
;; by executing M-x customize-group and then entering the group \"confluence\"
;; (or by browsing the file below).
;;
;; USING CONFLUENCE MODE
;;
;; To open a page, M-x confluence-get-page and enter the path to the
;; page, for example, to open a page in your home space: ~username/Tasks
;;
;; It is often convienient to bind this to a global key \\C-xwf in your .emacs file:
;;   
;;    (global-set-key \"\\C-xwf\" 'confluence-get-page)
;;
;; Once you have opened a page, made changes, simply saving the page
;; (\"\\C-x\\C-s\") will push the changes back to the wiki.
;;
;; To view the changes in your page versus what is in the wiki, type
;; \\C-xw=, or run M-x confluence-ediff-current-page.
;;
;; Also, if you want keybindings for confluence-mode, you can put the
;; following in your .emacs file:
;;
;; (add-hook 'confluence-edit-mode-hook
;;   (local-set-key \"\\C-xw\" confluence-prefix-map)
;;   (local-set-key \"\\M-j\" 'confluence-newline-and-indent)
;;   (local-set-key \"\\M-;\" 'confluence-list-indent-dwim))
;;
;; CONFLUENCE 4.0+
;;
;; In confluence version 4.0, Atlassian decided to change the wiki format.
;; They did away with the \"wiki\" format and changed the internal document
;; format to xml.  This makes editing confluence pages via emacs much less
;; enjoyable.  However, as of version 1.6 of this library, it is possible.
;; The somewhat simplistic confluence-xml-mode (simplistic compared to
;; confluence-mode) is an extension of nxml-mode.  It adds some minor
;; font-lock support, but otherwise leaves you with standard xml editing
;; support.  Confluence still has built in support for translating wiki format
;; pages to xml format pages, however, the reverse translation is more
;; problematic.
;;
;; Leveraging the excellent work of Graham Hannington
;; (http://www.amnet.net.au/~ghannington/confluence/readme.html), this package
;; provides a \"basic\" converter from xml to wiki format, however it can be
;; \"lossy\" depending on what advanced features a page contains.  A confluence
;; xml page can be converted to the wiki format using M-x
;; confluence-toggle-page-content-type.  This page can be saved as wiki format
;; (allowing confluence to do the reverse conversion on save) or can be
;; converted back to xml format (using the same command) and then saved
;; (allowing you to check the final content).  Note that the conversion from
;; xml to wiki format requires the external \"xsltproc\" program, which is
;; available on most unices and cygwin.
;;
;; For the truly brave, you can set the custom variable
;; confluence-xml-convert-to-wiki-on-load to t in order to automatically
;; convert xml content to wiki content on page load.
;;
;; LONGLINES
;;
;;   http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-en/LongLines
;;
;; Confluence uses a wiki-markup that treats linebreask as <p> HTML
;; tags.  Since this is the case, it is very common for paragraphs in
;; the Confluence markup to wrap around your buffer multiple times.
;; The LongLines mode allows those lines to be viewed within Emacs

;;
;; Company is a modular completion mechanism.  Modules for retrieving completion
;; candidates are called back-ends, modules for displaying them are front-ends.
;;
;; Company comes with many back-ends, e.g. `company-elisp'.  These are
;; distributed in separate files and can be used individually.
;;
;; Place company.el and the back-ends you want to use in a directory and add the
;; following to your .emacs:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/company\")
;; (autoload 'company-mode \"company\" nil t)
;;
;; Enable company-mode with M-x company-mode.  For further information look at
;; the documentation for `company-mode' (C-h f company-mode RET)
;;
;; If you want to start a specific back-end, call it interactively or use
;; `company-begin-backend'.  For example:
;; M-x company-abbrev will prompt for and insert an abbrev.
;;
;; To write your own back-end, look at the documentation for `company-backends'.
;; Here is a simple example completing \"foo\":
;;
;; (defun company-my-backend (command &optional arg &rest ignored)
;;   (case command
;;     (prefix (when (looking-back \"foo\\\\>\")
;;               (match-string 0)))
;;     (candidates (list \"foobar\" \"foobaz\" \"foobarbaz\"))
;;     (meta (format \"This value is named %s\" arg))))
;;
;; Sometimes it is a good idea to mix several back-ends together, for example to
;; enrich gtags with dabbrev-code results (to emulate local variables).
;; To do this, add a list with both back-ends as an element in company-backends.
;;
;; Known Issues:
;; When point is at the very end of the buffer, the pseudo-tooltip appears very
;; wrong, unless company is allowed to temporarily insert a fake newline.
;; This behavior is enabled by `company-end-of-buffer-workaround'.

;; background colors, by default).
;;
;; - With no prefix argument, each highlights the current column
;;   (where the cursor is).
;;
;; - With a non-negative numeric prefix argument, each highlights that
;;   column.
;;
;; - With plain `C-u' (no number), each turns off its highlighting.
;;
;; - With `C-u C-u', each turns off all column highlighting.
;;
;; If two commands highlight the same column, the last-issued
;; highlighting command shadows the other - only the last-issued
;; highlighting is seen.  If that \"topmost\" highlighting is then
;; turned off, the other highlighting for that column then shows
;; through.
;;
;; Examples:
;;
;; M-x column-marker-1 highlights the column where the cursor is, in

;; C-u 70 M-x column-marker-3 highlights column 70 in face

;;
;; C-u M-x column-marker-3 turns off highlighting for column-marker-3,
;; so face `column-marker-2' highlighting shows again for column 70.
;;
;; C-u C-u M-x column-marker-1 (or -2 or -3) erases all column
;; highlighting.
;;
;; These commands use `font-lock-fontify-buffer', so syntax
;; highlighting (`font-lock-mode') must be turned on.  There might be
;; a performance impact during refontification.
;;
;;
;; Installation: Place this file on your load path, and put this in

;;
;;  This library highlights the current column.  When you move the
;;  cursor, the highlighting follows (tracks the cursor), as long as
;;  the highlighting stays on.
;;
;;  Command `column-highlight-mode' toggles this highlighting on and
;;  off.
;;
;;  If you use `column-highlight-mode' twice in succession (I bind it
;;  to `C-+'), you can flash the highlighting to show you the current
;;  column temporarily.  An alternative way to flash-highlight is to
;;  use command `flash-column-highlight' (once).  It shows the
;;  highlighting for just a second or two (see option
;;  `col-highlight-period').
;;
;;  You can also have current-column highlighting come on
;;  automatically, when Emacs is idle.  Command
;;  `toggle-highlight-column-when-idle' toggles this mode.  Command
;;  `col-highlight-set-interval' changes the number of idle seconds to
;;  wait before highlighting.
;;
;;  You can use option `col-highlight-overlay-priority' to make the
;;  vline (i.e., column) highlighting appear on top of other overlay
;;  highlighting that might exist.
;;
;;  You can use option `col-highlight-show-only' to restrict
;;  current-column highlighting to a section of text of a particular
;;  kind: paragaph, sentence, page, defun, etc.
;;
;;
;;  To use this file, you must also have library `vline.el'.
;;  Put this in your Emacs init file (~/.emacs):
;;
;;    (require 'col-highlight) ; Load this file (and `vline')
;;
;;  If you want to turn on continual current-column highlighting by
;;  default, then add this to your init file:
;;
;;    (column-highlight-mode 1)
;;
;;  If you want to turn on automatic idle highlighting of the current
;;  column, then add this to your init file:
;;
;;    (toggle-highlight-column-when-idle 1)
;;
;;  If you want to use a different wait interval, before idle
;;  highlighting begins, then set it in your init file using
;;  `col-highlight-set-interval':
;;
;;    (col-highlight-set-interval 6) ; Wait 6 idle secs.
;;
;;  Note that `column-highlight-mode' is intentionally a global minor
;;  mode.  If you want a local minor mode, so that highlighting
;;  affects only a particular buffer, you can use `vline-mode' (in
;;  `vline.el').
;;
;;
;;  See also:
;;
;;  * Library `hl-line+.el', which offers the same functionality, but
;;    for the current line instead of the current column.
;;
;;  * Library `crosshairs.el', which combines the features of

;; CriticMarkup for Emacs
;; ======================
;;
;; `cm-mode' is a minor mode that provides support for CriticMarkup in Emacs.
;;
;; CriticMarkup is a way for authors and editors to track changes to
;; documents in plain text. It defines the following patterns for marking
;; changes:
;;
;; - Addition {++ ++}
;; - Deletion {-- --}
;; - Substitution {~~ ~> ~~}
;; - Comment {>> <<}
;; - Highlight {== ==}{>> <<}
;;
;; `cm-mode' provides the following functionality:
;;
;; - font lock support
;; - key bindings to insert CriticMarkup.
;; - 'follow changes' mode: automatically record changes to the buffer.
;; - accept/reject changes interactively.
;; - automatically add author tag.
;; - navigation to move between changes.
;;
;;
;; Key bindings
;; ------------
;;
;; `C-c * a' : add text
;; `C-c * d' : delete text
;; `C-c * s' : make a substitution
;; `C-c * c' : add a comment
;; `C-c * i' : accept/reject change at point
;; `C-c * I' : accept/reject all changes interactively
;; `C-c * *' : move forward out of a change
;; `C-c * f' : move forward to the next change
;; `C-c * b' : move backward to the previous change
;; `C-c * C' : set author
;; `C-c * F' : activate follow changes mode
;;

;; Clues was initially based on a Visual Studio theme called 'Blues 'n
;; Roots' however it's a long way from looking much like it, aside
;; from the occasional color accent, Blues (despite it's name) has a

;; cooling colors with a couple of flecks of light cream/brown/orange
;; to break up any monotony, with yellow/gold rainbow-delimiters.

;; ## Installation
;;
;; I highly recommended installing clj-refactor through elpa.
;;
;; It's available on [marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) and
;; [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):
;;
;;     M-x package-install clj-refactor
;;
;; You can also install the dependencies on your own, and just dump
;; clj-refactor in your path somewhere:
;;
;;  - <a href=\"https://github.com/magnars/s.el\">s.el</a>
;;  - <a href=\"https://github.com/magnars/dash.el\">dash.el</a>
;;

;; ## Setup
;;
;;     (require 'clj-refactor)
;;     (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook (lambda ()
;;                                    (clj-refactor-mode 1)
;;                                    ;; insert keybinding setup here
;;                                    ))
;;
;; You'll also have to set up the keybindings in the lambda. Read on.

;; ## Setup keybindings
;;
;; All functions in clj-refactor have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. You
;; get to choose how those are bound. Here's how:
;;
;;     (cljr-add-keybindings-with-prefix \"C-c C-m\")
;;     ;; eg. rename files with `C-c C-m rf`.
;;
;; If you would rather have a modifier key, instead of a prefix, do:
;;
;;     (cljr-add-keybindings-with-modifier \"C-s-\")
;;     ;; eg. rename files with `C-s-r C-s-f`.
;;
;; If neither of these appeal to your sense of keyboard layout aesthetics, feel free
;; to pick and choose your own keybindings with a smattering of:
;;
;;     (define-key clj-refactor-map (kbd \"C-x C-r\") 'cljr-rename-file)

;; ## Use
;;
;; This is it so far:
;;
;;  - `rf`: rename file, update ns-declaration, and then query-replace new ns in project.
;;  - `ar`: add :require to namespace declaration, then jump back
;;  - `au`: add :use to namespace declaration, then jump back
;;  - `ai`: add :import to namespace declaration, then jump back
;;  - `th`: thread another expression
;;  - `uw`: unwind a threaded expression
;;
;; Combine with your keybinding prefix/modifier.

;; ## Automatic insertion of namespace declaration
;;
;; When you open a blank `.clj`-file, clj-refactor inserts the namespace
;; declaration for you.
;;
;; It will also add the relevant `:use` clauses in test files, normally
;; using `clojure.test`, but if you're depending on midje in your
;; `project.clj` it uses that instead.
;;
;; Like clojure-mode, clj-refactor presumes that you are postfixing your
;; test files with `_test`.
;;
;; Prefer to insert your own ns-declarations? Then:
;;
;; (setq clj-add-ns-to-blank-clj-files nil)

;; provides support for imenu and hideshow.

;; - Add these lines to your .emacs file:
;;   (autoload 'clevercss-mode \"clevercss nil t)
;;   (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.pcss\\\\'\" . clevercss-mode))
;;  
;; This mode assumes that CleverCSS files have the suffix \".pcss\".
;; You may use additional suffixes by adding them to
;; `auto-mode-alist'.  For example, to add the suffix \".ccss\" you
;; would write the following in your .emacs file:
;; 
;; (add-to-list auto-mode-alist '(\"\\\\.ccss\\\\'\" . clevercss-mode))
;;
;; To customize how it works:

;; A suite of extensions for scheme-mode that grew out of necessity.
;;
;; Chicken Scheme does play well with SLIME (See also: chicken-slime.el), but
;; I often find myself working on software that is slow-level and unstable
;; enough to make such dependence on REPL reliability rather frustrating.
;;
;; Thus chicken-scheme.el was born. It does not rely on a running Scheme to
;; provide auto-complete support for your application. A suite of customization
;; variables are available to configure from which modules symbols should be
;; loaded and what sort of package prefixes can be expected.
;;
;; Auto-complete is configured to support prefixed symbols, to allow for
;; full recognition of symbols in modules that may have been imported with a
;; prefix modifier. The `chicken-prefix` variable may be customized to declare
;; what characters can be used as prefix delimiters.
;;
;; C-? is bound in Scheme Modes to fetch documentation for the symbol at the
;; current point. This obeys the prefix rules used for auto-complete.
;;
;; Further customization is available in the chicken-scheme customization group.
;;
;; Loading of the first scheme file may take some time as the Chicken Modules
;; are parsed for symbols on first-load. All subsequent scheme files do not
;; incur this load hitch. Consider running an Emacs daemon.
;;
;; Tags are also supported. 
;;
;; Installation:
;; Place in your load path. Add the following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (require 'chicken-scheme)
;;
;; Two Auto-Complete sources are available:
;;   ac-source-chicken-symbols
;;   ac-source-chicken-symbols-prefixed
;;
;; Prefixed symbols are those which have been mutated after importing a library.
;; See the chicken-prefix custom variable for customization options.
;;
;; I recommend you also add the following:
;;
;; (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'enable-paredit-mode)
;; (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode-enable)

;; piggybacks on font-lock.el, and is efficient.  Overlays are not
;; used.
;;
;; Button-lock buttons (links) can execute any function.
;;
;; There is little user-level interface for button-lock.el, which is
;; intended to be used from Emacs Lisp.  For a user-friendly library

;;     Miles Bader <miles@gnu.org>
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     By default, button-lock uses newfangled left-clicks rather than
;;     Emacs-traditional middle clicks.
;;
;;     Font lock is very efficient, but it is still possible to bog
;;     things down if you feed it expensive regular expressions.  Use
;;     anchored expressions, and be careful about backtracking.  See
;;     `regexp-opt'.
;;
;;     Some differences between button-lock.el and hi-lock.el:
;;
;;         * The purpose of hi-lock.el is to change the _appearance_
;;           of keywords.  The purpose of button-lock is to change the
;;           _bindings_ on keywords.
;;
;;         * Hi-lock also supports embedding new keywords in files,
;;           which is too risky of an approach for button-lock.
;;
;;         * Hi-lock supports overlays and can work without font-lock.
;;
;;     Some differences between button-lock.el and buttons.el
;;
;;         * Buttons.el is for inserting individually defined
;;           buttons.  Button-lock.el is for changing all matching text
;;           into a button.

;; Bugs
;;
;;     Case-sensitivity of matches depends on how font-lock-defaults
;;     was called for the current mode (setting
;;     font-lock-keywords-case-fold-search).  So, it is safest to
;;     assume that button-lock pattern matches are case-sensitive --
;;     though they might not be.
;;
;;     Return value for button-lock-register-global-button is inconsistent
;;     with button-lock-set-button.  The global function does not
;;     return a button which could be later passed to
;;     button-lock-extend-binding, nor are the arguments parsed and
;;     checked for validity.  Any errors for global buttons are also
;;     deferred until the mode is activated.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Validate arguments to button-lock-register-global-button.
;;     maybe split set-button into create/set functions, where
;;     the create function does all validation and returns a
;;     button object.  Pass in button object to unset as well.
;;
;;     Why are mouse and keyboard separate, can't mouse be passed
;;     through kbd macro?  The issue may have been just surrounding
;;     mouse events with \"<>\" before passing to kbd.
;;
;;     Look into new syntax-propertize-function variable (Emacs 24.x).
;;
;;     A refresh function to toggle every buffer?
;;
;;     Peek into font-lock-keywords and deduplicate based on the
;;     stored patterns.
;;
;;     Substitute a function for regexp to make properties invisible
;;     unless button-lock mode is on - esp for keymaps.
;;
;;     Add predicate argument to button-set where predicate is
;;     evaluated during matcher.  This could be used to test for
;;     comment-only.
;;
;;     Consider defining mode-wide button locks (pass the mode as the
;;     first argument of font-lock-add-keywords).  Could use functions
;;     named eg button-lock-set-modal-button.
;;
;;     Add a language-specific navigation library (header files in C,
;;     etc).
;;
;;     Example of exchanging text values on wheel event.
;;
;;     Convenience parameters for right-click menus.

;; Installation

;;
;;     git submodule add https://github.com/magnars/buster-snippets.el.git site-lisp/buster-snippets
;;
;; Then require buster-snippets at some point after yasnippet.
;;
;;     (require 'buster-snippets)

;; Customization

;; Add `\"use strict\"`-declarations to the test cases:
;;
;;     (setq buster-use-strict t)
;;
;; Declare `assert` and `refute` if you've disabled additional globals:
;;
;;     (setq buster-exposed-asserts nil)

;;             (when (string-match-p \"projects/zombietdd\" (buffer-file-name))

;;
;; Add the default global to the IIFE (immediately invoked function expression)
;;
;;     (setq buster-add-default-global-to-iife t)

;; 
;; Bitcoin donations gratefully accepted: 13NyoPq3iusGsCtHNRT9xfA9jsqPjYtyyE
;;
;; Extensions to emacs buffer-selection library (bs.el)
;; This extension allows you to bind keys to buffer selection configurations (using `bs-ext-config-keys'),
;; and optionally displays the configuration names and associated keybindings in the header line of the
;; *buffer-selection* buffer.
;; It also creates a new config called \"regexp\". When the \"/\" key is pressed the user is prompted for a regular
;; expression and any buffers with matching names are added to the \"regexp\" config.
;;
;; The following new keybindings are defined:
;;
;; /        : prompt user for regular expression, place matching buffers in \"regexp\" config, and change to that config
;; <left>   : select previous config using `bs-ext-select-previous-configuration'
;; <right>  : select next config using `bs-ext-select-next-configuration'
;; x        : kill buffer on current line using `bs-delete'
;;
;; Also if you have color-moccur installed you can use M-O to find regexp matches in marked buffers.


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put bs-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name \"~/elisp\"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'bs-ext)

"]) (browse-url-dwim . [(20131106 706) ((string-utils (0 3 2))) "Context-sensitive external browse URL or Internet search" single ";;; Commentary:
;;
;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'browse-url-dwim)
;;
;;     (browse-url-dwim-mode 1)
;;
;;     place the cursor on a URL
;;     press \"C-c b\"
;;
;;     select some text
;;     press \"C-c g\"
;;
;;     ;; to turn off confirmations
;;     (setq browse-url-dwim-always-confirm-extraction nil)
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; This small library for calling external browsers combines some of
;; the functionality of `browse-url' and `thingatpt'.
;;
;; Three interactive commands are provided:
;;
;;     `browse-url-dwim'
;;     `browse-url-dwim-search'
;;     `browse-url-dwim-guess'
;;
;; each of which tries to extract URLs or meaningful terms from
;; context in the current buffer, and prompts for input when unable
;; to do so.
;;
;; The context-sensitive matching of `browse-url-dwim' tries to do
;; _less_ overall than the default behavior of `thingatpt', on the
;; theory that `thingatpt' matches too liberally.  However,
;; `browse-url-dwim' does recognize some URLs that the default
;; `browse-url' ignores, such as \"www.yahoo.com\" without the
;; leading \"http://\".
;;
;; To use `browse-url-dwim', add the following to your ~/.emacs file
;;
;;     (require 'browse-url-dwim)      ; load library
;;     (browse-url-dwim-mode 1)        ; install aliases and keybindings
;;
;; Then place the cursor on a URL and press
;;
;;     C-c b                           ; b for browse
;;
;; or select some text and press
;;
;;     C-c g                           ; g for Google
;;
;; or (equivalently)
;;
;;     M-x browse RET
;;     M-x google RET
;;
;; Outside the USA
;;
;; If you are outside the USA, you will want to customize
;; `browse-url-dwim-permitted-tlds' so that your favorite
;; top-level domains will be recognized in context.  You
;; may also wish to customize `browse-url-dwim-search-url'
;; to point at an appropriate search engine.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET browse-url-dwim RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET browse-url RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;; To control which browser is invoked, see the underlying library
;; `browse-url'.
;;
;; By default, the minor mode binds and aliases `browse-url-dwim-guess'
;; for Internet search, but the user might prefer to bind
;; `browse-url-dwim-search', which has less DWIM:
;;
;;     (define-key browse-url-dwim-map (kbd \"C-c g\") 'browse-url-dwim-search)

;;
;;     Uses if present: string-utils.el
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     `thing-at-point-short-url-regexp' requires at least two dots in the hostname,
;;     so \"domain.com\" cannot be detected at point, whereas the following will be:
;;     \"www.domain.com\" or \"http://domain.com\"
;;
;;     `url-normalize-url' doesn't do much.  Multiple slashes should be removed
;;     for a start.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     Support thing-nearest-point, with fallback.
;;
;;     Test various schemes, esp \"file:\", \"mailto:\", and \"ssh:\".
;;
;;     Extract multiple URLs from region and browse to all.

;;    `bookmark+-mac.el' - Lisp macros
;;    `bookmark+-lit.el' - (optional) code for highlighting bookmarks

;;    `bookmark+-chg.el' - change log (comment-only file)
;;
;;    The documentation (in `bookmark+-doc.el') includes how to
;;    byte-compile and install Bookmark+.  The documentation is also
;;    available in these ways:
;;
;;    1. From the bookmark list (`C-x r l'):
;;       Use `?' to show the current bookmark-list status and general
;;       help, then click link `Doc in Commentary' or link `Doc on the
;;       Web'.
;;
;;    2. From the Emacs-Wiki Web site:
;;       http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/BookmarkPlus.
;;
;;    3. From the Bookmark+ group customization buffer:
;;       `M-x customize-group bookmark-plus', then click link
;;       `Commentary'.
;;
;;    (The commentary links in #1 and #3 work only if you have library
;;    `bookmark+-doc.el' in your `load-path'.)
;;
;;
;;    ****** NOTE ******
;;
;;      Whenever you update Bookmark+ (i.e., download new versions of
;;      Bookmark+ source files), I recommend that you do the
;;      following:
;;
;;      1. Delete all existing byte-compiled Bookmark+ files
;;         (bookmark+*.elc).
;;      2. Load Bookmark+ (`load-library' or `require').
;;      3. Byte-compile the source files.
;;
;;      In particular, always load `bookmark+-mac.el' (not
;;      `bookmark+-mac.elc') before you byte-compile new versions of
;;      the files, in case there have been any changes to Lisp macros
;;      (in `bookmark+-mac.el').
;;
;;    ******************
;;
;;
;;    ****** NOTE ******
;;
;;      On 2010-06-18, I changed the prefix used by package Bookmark+
;;      from `bookmarkp-' to `bmkp-'.  THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.
;;      I apologize for the inconvenience, but the new prefix is
;;      preferable for a number of reasons, including easier
;;      distinction from standard `bookmark.el' names.
;;
;;      This change means that YOU MUST MANUALLY REPLACE ALL
;;      OCCURRENCES of `bookmarkp-' by `bmkp-' in the following
;;      places, if you used Bookmark+ prior to this change:
;;
;;      1. In your init file (`~/.emacs') or your `custom-file', if
;;         you have one.  This is needed if you customized any
;;         Bookmark+ features.
;;
;;      2. In your default bookmark file, `bookmark-default-file'
;;         (`.emacs.bmk'), and in any other bookmark files you might
;;         have.
;;
;;      3. In your `*Bookmark List*' state file,
;;         `bmkp-bmenu-state-file' (`~/.emacs-bmk-bmenu-state.el').
;;
;;      4. In your `*Bookmark List*' commands file,
;;         `bmkp-bmenu-commands-file' (`~/.emacs-bmk-bmenu-commands.el'),
;;         if you have one.
;;
;;      You can do this editing in a virgin Emacs session (`emacs
;;      -Q'), that is, without loading Bookmark+.
;;
;;      Alternatively, you can do this editing in an Emacs session
;;      where Bookmark+ has been loaded, but in that case you must
;;      TURN OFF AUTOMATIC SAVING of both your default bookmark file
;;      and your `*Bookmark List*' state file.  Otherwise, when you
;;      quit Emacs your manually edits will be overwritten.
;;
;;      To turn off this automatic saving, you can use `M-~' and `M-l'
;;      in buffer `*Bookmark List*' (commands
;;      `bmkp-toggle-saving-bookmark-file' and
;;      `bmkp-toggle-saving-menu-list-state' - they are also in the
;;      `Bookmark+' menu).
;;
;;
;;      Again, sorry for this inconvenience.

;;; Description:
;;
;;   This package was created because I missed the bookmarks from M$
;;   Visual Studio. I find that they provide an easy way to navigate
;;   in a buffer.
;;
;;   bm.el provides visible, buffer local, bookmarks and the ability
;;   to jump forward and backward to the next bookmark.
;;
;;   Features:
;;    - Toggle bookmarks with `bm-toggle' and navigate forward and
;;      backward in buffer with `bm-next' and `bm-previous'.
;;
;;    - Different wrapping modes, see `bm-wrap-search' and
;;      `bm-wrap-immediately'. Use `bm-toggle-wrapping' to turn
;;      wrapping on/off. Wrapping is only available when
;;      `bm-cycle-all-buffers' is nil.

;;; Known limitations:
;;
;;   This package is developed and tested on GNU Emacs 23.x. It should
;;   work on all GNU Emacs 21.x, GNU Emacs 22.x and also on XEmacs
;;   21.x with some limitations.
;;
;;   There are some incompatibilities with lazy-lock when using
;;   fill-paragraph. All bookmark below the paragraph being filled
;;   will be lost. This issue can be resolved using the
;;   `jit-lock-mode' introduced in GNU Emacs 21.1
;;
;;   Bookmarks will be extended when inserting text (before, inside or
;;   after) bookmark in XEmacs. This is due to the missing support for
;;   overlay hooks i XEmacs.


;;; Installation:
;;
;;   To use bm.el, put it in your load-path and add
;;   the following to your .emacs
;;
;;   (require 'bm)
;;
;; or
;;
;;   (autoload 'bm-toggle   \"bm\" \"Toggle bookmark in current buffer.\" t)
;;   (autoload 'bm-next     \"bm\" \"Goto bookmark.\"                     t)
;;   (autoload 'bm-previous \"bm\" \"Goto previous bookmark.\"            t)
;;


;;; Configuration:
;;
;;   To make it easier to use, assign the commands to some keys.
;;
;;   M$ Visual Studio key setup.
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<C-f2>\") 'bm-toggle)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<f2>\")   'bm-next)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<S-f2>\") 'bm-previous)
;;
;;   Click on fringe to toggle bookmarks, and use mouse wheel to move
;;   between them.
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<left-fringe> <mouse-5>\") 'bm-next-mouse)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<left-fringe> <mouse-4>\") 'bm-previous-mouse)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd \"<left-fringe> <mouse-1>\") 'bm-toggle-mouse)
;;
;;   If you would like the markers on the right fringe instead of the
;;   left, add the following to line:
;;
;;   (setq bm-marker 'bm-marker-right)
;;



;;; Persistence:
;;
;;   Bookmark persistence is achieved by storing bookmark data in a
;;   repository when a buffer is killed. The repository is saved to
;;   disk on exit. See `bm-repository-file'. The maximum size of the
;;   repository is controlled by `bm-repository-size'.
;;
;;   The buffer local variable `bm-buffer-persistence' decides if
;;   bookmarks in a buffer is persistent or not. Non-file buffers
;;   can't have persistent bookmarks, except for *info* and
;;   indirect buffers.
;;
;;   Bookmarks are non-persistent as default. To have bookmarks
;;   persistent as default add the following line to .emacs.
;;
;;   ;; make bookmarks persistent as default
;;   (setq-default bm-buffer-persistence t)

;;   Use the function `bm-toggle-buffer-persistence' to toggle
;;   bookmark persistence.
;;
;;   To have automagic bookmark persistence we need to add some
;;   functions to the following hooks. Insert the following code
;;   into your .emacs file:
;;
;;   If you are using desktop or other packages that restore buffers
;;   on start up, bookmarks will not be restored. When using
;;   `after-init-hook' to restore the repository, it will be restored
;;   *after* .emacs is finished. To load the repository when bm is
;;   loaded set the variable `bm-restore-repository-on-load' to t,
;;   *before* loading bm (and don't use the `after-init-hook').
;;
;;   ;; Make sure the repository is loaded as early as possible
;;   (setq bm-restore-repository-on-load t)
;;   (require 'bm)
;;
;;   ;; Loading the repository from file when on start up.
;;   (add-hook' after-init-hook 'bm-repository-load)
;;
;;   ;; Restoring bookmarks when on file find.
;;   (add-hook 'find-file-hooks 'bm-buffer-restore)
;;
;;   ;; Saving bookmark data on killing a buffer
;;   (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook 'bm-buffer-save)
;;
;;   ;; Saving the repository to file when on exit.
;;   ;; kill-buffer-hook is not called when Emacs is killed, so we
;;   ;; must save all bookmarks first.
;;   (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook '(lambda nil
;;                                   (bm-buffer-save-all)
;;                                   (bm-repository-save)))
;;
;;   ;; Update bookmark repository when saving the file.
;;   (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'bm-buffer-save)
;;
;;   ;; Restore bookmarks when buffer is reverted.
;;   (add-hook 'after-revert-hook 'bm-buffer-restore)
;;
;;
;;   The `after-save-hook' and `after-revert-hook' is not necessary to
;;   use to achieve persistence, but it makes the bookmark data in
;;   repository more in sync with the file state.
;;
;;   The `after-revert-hook' might cause trouble when using packages
;;   that automatically reverts the buffer (like vc after a check-in).
;;   This can easily be avoided if the package provides a hook that is
;;   called before the buffer is reverted (like `vc-before-checkin-hook').
;;   Then new bookmarks can be saved before the buffer is reverted.
;;
;;   ;; make sure bookmarks is saved before check-in (and revert-buffer)
;;   (add-hook 'vc-before-checkin-hook 'bm-buffer-save)

"]) (blank-mode . [(20130824 1159) nil "minor mode to visualize TAB, (HARD) SPACE, NEWLINE" single ";;; Commentary:

;; ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;;
;; Introduction
;; ------------
;;
;; This package is a minor mode to visualize blanks (TAB, (HARD) SPACE
;; and NEWLINE).
;;
;; blank-mode uses two ways to visualize blanks: faces and display
;; table.
;;
;; * Faces are used to highlight the background with a color.
;;   blank-mode uses font-lock to highlight blank characters.
;;
;; * Display table changes the way a character is displayed, that is,
;;   it provides a visual mark for characters, for example, at the end
;;   of line (?\\xB6), at SPACEs (?\\xB7) and at TABs (?\\xBB).
;;
;; The `blank-style' and `blank-chars' variables are used to select
;; which way should be used to visualize blanks.
;;
;; Note that when blank-mode is turned on, blank-mode saves the
;; font-lock state, that is, if font-lock is on or off.  And
;; blank-mode restores the font-lock state when it is turned off.  So,
;; if blank-mode is turned on and font-lock is off, blank-mode also
;; turns on the font-lock to highlight blanks, but the font-lock will
;; be turned off when blank-mode is turned off.  Thus, turn on
;; font-lock before blank-mode is on, if you want that font-lock
;; continues on after blank-mode is turned off.
;;
;; When blank-mode is on, it takes care of highlighting some special
;; characters over the default mechanism of `nobreak-char-display'
;; (which see) and `show-trailing-whitespace' (which see).
;;
;; There are two ways of using blank-mode: local and global.
;;
;; * Local blank-mode affects only the current buffer.
;;
;; * Global blank-mode affects all current and future buffers.  That
;;   is, if you turn on global blank-mode and then create a new
;;   buffer, the new buffer will also have blank-mode on.  The
;;   `blank-global-modes' variable controls which major-mode will be
;;   automagically turned on.
;;
;; You can mix the local and global usage without any conflict.  But
;; local blank-mode has priority over global blank-mode.  Blank mode
;; is active in a buffer if you have enabled it in that buffer or if
;; you have enabled it globally.
;;
;; When global and local blank-mode are on:
;;
;; * if local blank-mode is turned off, blank-mode is turned off for
;;   the current buffer only.
;;
;; * if global blank-mode is turned off, blank-mode continues on only
;;   in the buffers in which local blank-mode is on.
;;
;; To use blank-mode, insert in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'blank-mode)
;;
;; Or autoload at least one of the commands`blank-mode',
;; `blank-toggle-options', `global-blank-mode' or
;; `global-blank-toggle-options'.  For example:
;;
;;    (autoload 'blank-mode                  \"blank-mode\"
;;      \"Toggle blank visualization.\"          t)
;;    (autoload 'blank-toggle-options        \"blank-mode\"
;;      \"Toggle local `blank-mode' options.\"   t)
;;
;; blank-mode was inspired by:
;;
;;    whitespace.el            Rajesh Vaidheeswarran <rv@gnu.org>
;;	Warn about and clean bogus whitespaces in the file
;;	(inspired the idea to warn and clean some blanks)
;;
;;    show-whitespace-mode.el  Aurelien Tisne <aurelien.tisne@free.fr>
;;       Simple mode to highlight whitespaces
;;       (inspired the idea to use font-lock)
;;
;;    whitespace-mode.el       Lawrence Mitchell <wence@gmx.li>
;;       Major mode for editing Whitespace
;;       (inspired the idea to use display table)
;;
;;    visws.el                 Miles Bader <miles@gnu.org>
;;       Make whitespace visible
;;       (handle display table, his code was modified, but the main
;;       idea was kept)
;;
;;
;; Using blank-mode
;; ----------------
;;
;; There is no problem if you mix local and global minor mode usage.
;;
;; * LOCAL blank-mode:
;;    + To toggle blank-mode options locally, type:
;;
;;         M-x blank-toggle-options RET
;;
;;    + To activate blank-mode locally, type:
;;
;;         C-u 1 M-x blank-mode RET
;;
;;    + To deactivate blank-mode locally, type:
;;
;;         C-u 0 M-x blank-mode RET
;;
;;    + To toggle blank-mode locally, type:
;;
;;         M-x blank-mode RET
;;
;; * GLOBAL blank-mode:
;;    + To toggle blank-mode options globally, type:
;;
;;         M-x global-blank-toggle-options RET
;;
;;    + To activate blank-mode globally, type:
;;
;;         C-u 1 M-x global-blank-mode RET
;;
;;    + To deactivate blank-mode globally, type:
;;
;;         C-u 0 M-x global-blank-mode RET
;;
;;    + To toggle blank-mode globally, type:
;;
;;         M-x global-blank-mode RET
;;
;; There are also the following useful commands:
;;
;; `blank-cleanup'
;;    Cleanup some blank problems in all buffer or at region.
;;
;; `blank-cleanup-region'
;;    Cleanup some blank problems at region.
;;
;; The problems, which are cleaned up, are:
;;
;; 1. empty lines at beginning of buffer.
;; 2. empty lines at end of buffer.
;;    If `blank-chars' has `empty' as an element, remove all empty
;;    lines at beginning and/or end of buffer.
;;
;; 3. 8 or more SPACEs at beginning of line.
;;    If `blank-chars' has `indentation' as an element, replace 8 or
;;    more SPACEs at beginning of line by TABs.
;;
;; 4. SPACEs before TAB.
;;    If `blank-chars' has `space-before-tab' as an element, replace
;;    SPACEs by TABs.
;;
;; 5. SPACEs or TABs at end of line.
;;    If `blank-chars' has `trailing' as an element, remove all
;;    SPACEs or TABs at end of line.\"
;;
;; 6. 8 or more SPACEs after TAB.
;;    If `blank-chars' has `space-after-tab' as an element, replace
;;    SPACEs by TABs.
;;
;;
;; Hooks
;; -----
;;
;; blank-mode has the following hook variables:
;;
;; `blank-mode-hook'
;;    It is evaluated always when blank-mode is turned on locally.
;;
;; `global-blank-mode-hook'
;;    It is evaluated always when blank-mode is turned on globally.
;;
;; `blank-load-hook'
;;    It is evaluated after blank-mode package is loaded.

;; Provides a function `bibslurp-query-ads', which reads a search
;; string from the minibuffer, sends the query to NASA ADS
;; (http://adswww.harvard.edu/), and displays the results in a new
;; buffer called \"ADS Search Results\".

;; The \"ADS Search Results\" buffer opens in `bibslurp-mode', which
;; provides a few handy functions.  Typing the number preceding an
;; abstract and hitting RET calls `bibslurp-slurp-bibtex', which
;; fetches the bibtex entry corresponding to the abstract and saves it
;; to the kill ring.  Typing 'a' instead pulls up the abstract page.
;; At anytime, you can hit 'q' to quit bibslurp-mode and restore the
;; previous window configuration.

;;; Example usage:

;; add an entry to a bibtex buffer:
;;   M-x bibslurp-query-ads RET ^Quataert 2008
;;   1 RET
;;   q
;;   C-y

;; For more examples and information see the project page at
;; http://astro.berkeley.edu/~mkmcc/software/bibslurp.html

;;; Notes about the implementation:

;; 1. As far as I know, ADS doesn't have an API for searching its
;;   database, and emacs doesn't have functionality to parse html.
;;   Since I don't want to implement a browser in emacs lisp, that
;;   leaves me parsing the html pages with regexps.  While that would
;;   be a terrible idea under ordinary circumstances, the ADS pages
;;   are all automatically generated, so they should conform to a
;;   pretty regular format.  That gives me some hope...

;; 2. There are many ways you can customize the behaviour of biblurp.
;;    I define font-lock faces at the beginning of the file so you can
;;    add these to your color theme.  I also run a mode hook at the
;;    end of `bibslurp-mode', so you can inject your own code at that
;;    point.

;;; Installation:

;; Use package.el. You'll need to add MELPA to your archives:

;; (require 'package)
;; (add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\") t)

;; Alternatively, you can just save this file and do the standard
;; (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/bibslurp.el\")
;; (require 'bibslurp)

;;
;; This program searches the web for BibTeX entries matching the given
;; Author end/or Title.  It displays then a selection buffer, that permits
;; to examine and choose entries to add to the bibliography file, or to
;; insert into the current buffer.

;; The function is called through \"M-x bibretrieve\".  Then it prompts for
;; author and title.  For an advanced use, that permits to select which
;; backend to use, call it with \"C-u M-x bibretrieve\".

;; The configuration is done with the variable bibretrieve-backends, that
;; is an alist with pairs containing the backend to use and the timeout
;; for it. See the README file for the list of supported backends.

;; To create a new backend define a new function
;; \"bibretrieve-BACKEND-create-url\" that takes as input author and title
;; and returns a url that, when retrieved, gives some bibtex entries.
;; The function should be defined in \"bibretrieve-base.el\".
;; It is then necessary to advise bibretrieve of the new backend,
;; adding it to the list \"bibretrieve-installed-backends\".

;; The url is retrieved via mm-url.  You may want to customize the
;; variable mm-url-use-external and mm-url-program.

;; Acknowledgments: This program has been inspired by bibsnarf.  The
;; functions that create the urls for most backends are taken from
;; there.  This program uses the library mm-url.  This programs also uses
;; lot of function of RefTeX.  The selection process is entirely based on
;; reftex-sel.  Many function have also been adapted from there.

;; Purpose
;; =======
;;
;; Import and export of vCards as defined in RFC 2425 and RFC 2426
;; to/from The Insidious Big Brother Database (BBDB).
;;
;;
;; Usage
;; =====
;;
;; vCard Import
;; ------------
;;
;; On a file, a buffer or a region containing one or more vCards, use
;; `bbdb-vcard-import-file', `bbdb-vcard-import-buffer', or
;; `bbdb-vcard-import-region' respectively to import them into BBDB.
;;
;; Preferred input format is vCard version 3.0.  Version 2.1 vCards
;; are converted to version 3.0 on import.
;;
;;
;; vCard Export
;; ------------
;;
;; In buffer *BBDB*, press v to export the record under point.  Press
;; * v to export all records in buffer into one vCard file.  Press *
;; C-u v to export them into one file each.
;;
;; To put one or all vCard(s) into the kill ring, press V or * V
;; respectively.
;;
;; Exported vCards are always version 3.0.  They can be re-imported
;; without data loss with one exception: North American phone numbers
;; lose their structure and are stored as flat strings.
;;
;;
;; There are a few customization variables grouped under `bbdb-vcard'.
;;
;;
;; Installation
;; ============
;;
;; Put this file and file vcard.el into your `load-path' and add the
;; following line to your Emacs initialization file:
;;
;;   (require 'bbdb-vcard)
;;
;;
;; Implementation
;; ==============
;;
;; vCard Import
;; ------------
;;
;; For conversion of v2.1 vCards into v3.0 on import, Noah Friedman's
;; vcard.el is needed.
;;
;; An existing BBDB record is extended by new information from a vCard
;;
;;   (a) if name and company and an email address match
;;   (b) or if name and company match
;;   (c) or if name and an email address match
;;   (d) or if name and birthday match
;;   (e) or if name and a phone number match.
;;
;; Otherwise, a fresh BBDB record is created.
;;
;; When `bbdb-vcard-try-merge' is set to nil, there is always a fresh
;; record created.
;;
;; In cases (c), (d), and (e), if the vCard has ORG defined, this ORG
;; would overwrite an existing Company in BBDB.
;;
;; Phone numbers are always imported as strings.
;;
;; For vCard types that have more or less direct counterparts in BBDB,
;; labels and parameters are translated and structured values
;; (lastname; firstname; additional names; prefixes etc.) are
;; converted appropriately with the risk of some (hopefully
;; unessential) information loss.  For labels of the vCard types ADR
;; and TEL, parameter translation is defined in
;; `bbdb-vcard-import-translation-table'.
;;
;; If there is a REV element, it is stored in BBDB's creation-date in
;; newly created BBDB records, or discarded for existing ones.  Time
;; and time zone information from REV are stored there as well if
;; there are any, but are ignored by BBDB (v2.36).
;;
;; VCard type prefixes (A.ADR:..., B.ADR:... etc.) are stripped off
;; and discarded from the following types: N, FN, NICKNAME, ORG (first
;; occurrence), ADR, TEL, EMAIL, URL, BDAY (first occurrence), NOTE.
;;
;; VCard types that are prefixed `X-BBDB-' are stored in BBDB without
;; the prefix.
;;
;; VCard type X-BBDB-ANNIVERSARY may contain (previously exported)
;; newline-separated non-birthday anniversaries that are meant to be
;; read by org-mode.
;;
;; All remaining vCard types that don't match the regexp in
;; `bbdb-vcard-skip-on-import' and that have a non-empty value are
;; stored unaltered in the BBDB Notes alist where, for instance,
;; `TZ;VALUE=text:-05:00' is stored as `(tz\\;value=text . \"-05:00\")'.
;; From the BBDB data fields AKA, Phones, Addresses, Net Addresses,
;; and Notes, duplicates are removed, respectively.
;;
;; VCards found inside other vCards (as values of type AGENT) are
;; imported as well.
;;
;;
;; Handling of the individual types defined in RFC2426 during import
;; (assuming default label translation and no vCard type exclusion):

;;
;; This file defines dynamic completion hooks for shell-mode and
;; shell-command prompts that are based on bash completion.
;;
;; You will need shell-command.el to get tab completion in the
;; minibuffer. See http://www.namazu.org/~tsuchiya/elisp/shell-command.el
;;
;; Bash completion for emacs:
;; - is aware of bash builtins, aliases and functions
;; - does file expansion inside of colon-separated variables
;;   and after redirections (> or <)
;; - escapes special characters when expanding file names
;; - is configurable through programmable bash completion
;;
;; When the first completion is requested in shell model or a shell
;; command, bash-completion.el starts a separate bash
;; process.  Bash-completion.el then uses this process to do the actual
;; completion and includes it into Emacs completion suggestions.
;;
;; A simpler and more complete alternative to bash-completion.el is to
;; run a bash shell in a buffer in term mode(M-x `ansi-term').
;; Unfortunately, many Emacs editing features are not available when
;; running in term mode.  Also, term mode is not available in
;; shell-command prompts.
;;
;; INSTALLATION
;;
;; 1. copy bash-completion.el into a directory that's on Emacs load-path
;; 2. add this into your .emacs file:
;;   (autoload 'bash-completion-dynamic-complete \\\"bash-completion\\\"
;;     \\\"BASH completion hook\\\")
;;   (add-hook 'shell-dynamic-complete-functions
;; 	'bash-completion-dynamic-complete)
;;   (add-hook 'shell-command-complete-functions
;; 	'bash-completion-dynamic-complete)
;;
;;   or simpler, but forces you to load this file at startup:
;;
;;   (require 'bash-completion)
;;   (bash-completion-setup)
;;
;; 3. reload your .emacs (M-x `eval-buffer') or restart
;;
;; Once this is done, use <TAB> as usual to do dynamic completion from
;; shell mode or a shell command minibuffer, such as the one started
;; for M-x `compile'. Note that the first completion is slow, as emacs
;; launches a new bash process.
;;
;; You'll get better results if you turn on programmable bash completion.
;; On Ubuntu, this means running:
;;   sudo apt-get install bash-completion
;; and then adding this to your .bashrc:
;;   . /etc/bash_completion
;;
;; Right after enabling programmable bash completion, and whenever you
;; make changes to you .bashrc, call `bash-completion-reset' to make
;; sure bash completion takes your new settings into account.
;;
;; Loading /etc/bash_completion often takes time, and is not necessary
;; in shell mode, since completion is done by a separate process, not
;; the process shell-mode process.
;;
;; To turn off bash completion when running from emacs but keep it on
;; for processes started by bash-completion.el, add this to your .bashrc:
;; if [[ ( -z \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" || \"$EMACS_BASH_COMPLETE\" = \"t\" ) &&\\
;;      -f /etc/bash_completion ]]; then
;;   . /etc/bash_completion
;; fi
;;
;; Emacs sets the environment variable INSIDE_EMACS to the processes
;; started from it. Processes started by bash-completion.el have
;; the environment variable EMACS_BASH_COMPLETE set to t.
;;
;; CAVEATS
;;
;; Using a separate process for doing the completion has several
;; important disadvantages:
;; - bash completion is slower than standard emacs completion
;; - the first completion can take a long time, since a new bash process
;;   needs to be started and initialized
;; - the separate process is not aware of any changes made to bash
;;   in the current buffer.
;;   In a standard terminal, you could do:
;;     $ alias myalias=ls
;;     $ myal<TAB>
;;   and bash would propose the new alias.
;;   Bash-completion.el cannot do that, as it is not aware of anything
;;   configured in the current shell. To make bash-completion.el aware
;;   of a new alias, you need to add it to .bashrc and restart the
;;   completion process using `bash-completion-reset'.
;;
;; COMPATIBILITY
;;
;; bash-completion.el is quite sensitive to the OS and BASH version.
;; This package is known to work on the following environment:
;;   GNU Emacs 22.3.1 (Aquamacs 1.7)
;;   GNU Emacs 22.1.1 (OSX 10.5)
;;   GNU Emacs 22.1.1 (Ubuntu 8.04)
;;   GNU Emacs 23.0.94.1 (Ubuntu 8.10)
;;
;; and using the following bash versions:
;;   BASH 3.2.17
;;   BASH 3.2.32
;;   BASH 3.2.39
;;
;; bash-completion.el does not works on XEmacs.

;; Quickstart
;;
;;     (require 'back-button)
;;
;;     (back-button-mode 1)
;;
;;     press the plus sign in the toolbar to create a mark
;;
;;     press the arrows in the toolbar to navigate marks
;;
;;     or use C-x C-Space as usual, then try C-x C-<right>
;;     to reverse the operation
;;
;; Explanation
;;
;; Back-button provides an alternative method for navigation by
;; analogy with the \"back\" button in a web browser.
;;
;; Every Emacs command which pushes the mark leaves behind an
;; invisible record of the location of the point at that moment.
;; Back-button moves the point back and forth over all the positions
;; where some command pushed the mark.
;;
;; This is essentially a replacement for `pop-global-mark', and the
;; default keybindings (when the minor mode is activated) override
;; that command.  The differences with `pop-global-mark' are:
;;
;;    - Visual index showing how far you have traveled in the
;;      mark ring.
;;
;;    - Easy way to move both forward and backward in the ring.
;;
;;    - Pushes a mark on the first of a series of invocations, so you
;;      can always return to where you issued the command.
;;
;;    - Skips duplicate positions, so that the interactive command
;;      always moves the point if possible.
;;
;; Commands and keybindings are also included to give identical
;; semantics for navigating the local (per-buffer) `mark-ring'.  This
;; consistency in navigation comes at the cost of pushing the mark
;; twice, so experienced Emacs users may prefer to unbind these
;; commands and/or set `back-button-never-push-mark' in customize.
;;
;; To use back-button, place the back-button.el library somewhere
;; Emacs can find it, and add the following to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;     (require 'back-button)
;;     (back-button-mode 1)
;;
;; Default key bindings:
;;
;;     C-x C-<SPC>    go back in `global-mark-ring', respects prefix arg
;;     C-x C-<left>   go back in `global-mark-ring'
;;     C-x C-<right>  go forward in `global-mark-ring'
;;
;;     C-x <SPC>      go back in (buffer-local) `mark-ring', respects prefix arg
;;     C-x <left>     go back in (buffer-local) `mark-ring'
;;     C-x <right>    go forward in (buffer-local) `mark-ring'
;;
;; When the smartrep package is installed, the C-x prefix need not
;; be used for consecutive back-button commands.
;;
;; When the visible-mark package is installed, marks will be
;; made visible in the current buffer during navigation.
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;     M-x customize-group RET back-button RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET editing-basics RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET visible-mark RET
;;     M-x customize-group RET nav-flash RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;     This library depends upon other commands pushing the mark to
;;     provide useful waypoints for navigation.  This is a common
;;     convention, but not universal.
;;
;;     The function `back-button-push-mark-local-and-global' may be
;;     useful to call from Lisp.  It is a replacement for `push-mark'
;;     which unconditionally pushes onto the global mark ring,
;;     functionality which is not possible using vanilla `push-mark'.
;;
;;     Theoretically, `back-button-push-mark-local-and-global' could
;;     cause issues with Lisp code which depends on the convention that
;;     `global-mark-ring' not contain consecutive marks in the same
;;     buffer.  However, no such issues have been observed.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements

;;     GNU Emacs version 24.3           : yes

;;                      ucs-utils.el
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;     Pressing the toolbar back-button can navigate to a different
;;     buffer with a different toolbar (and no back-button).
;;
;;     Toolbar button disabling is not dependable.  Logic is left
;;     in place but unused.
;;
;;     Toolbar shift-click does not work in Cocoa Emacs.
;;
;;     Toolbar shift-click is not consistent with keyboard bindings
;;     (control for global ring, unmodified for local ring)
;;
;;     Displaying the index in a popup requires unreleased popup-volatile.el
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;     better toolbar icons
;;
;;     bug in visible-mark bug when mark is on last char of line
;;
;;     integrated delete-mark
;;
;;     could remove smartrep and implement mini-mode that includes
;;     extra commands such as delete-mark and perhaps digits
;;     for visible marks
;;
;;     Used to remember thumb between series, so long as no mark was
;;     pushed, now that does not work b/c these functions themselves
;;     push the mark -- make that an option?  Maybe the right way is
;;     to keep it out-of-band.
;;
;;     this is a crude but general way to force a navigation
;;     command to push the mark:
;;
;;         (defvar push-mark-before-goto-char nil)
;;         (defadvice goto-char (before push-mark-first activate)
;;           (when push-mark-before-goto-char
;;             (back-button-push-mark-local-and-global nil t)))
;;         ;; example use
;;         (defun ido-imenu-push-mark ()
;;           (interactive)
;;           (let ((push-mark-before-goto-char t))
;;             (ido-imenu)))
;;
;;     A better way would be: using a pre-command-hook, track series of
;;     related navigation commands (defined by a property placed on
;;     each command).  Push a global mark for the first of a related
;;     series, don't push for subsequent.  There is already a property
;;     placed on some navigation commands which might be sufficient -
;;     or is that only scroll commands?  There is a package AutoMark
;;     which purports to do this, but it doesn't do the hard part of
;;     classifying all commands.

"]) (babel . [(20131231 725) nil "interface to web translation services such as Babelfish" single ";;; Commentary:

;;; Overview ==========================================================
;;
;; This module provides an Emacs interface to different translation
;; services available on the Internet. You give it a word or paragraph
;; to translate and select the source and destination languages, and
;; it connects to the translation server, retrieves the data, and
;; presents it in a special *babel* buffer. Currently the following
;; backends are available:
;;
;;  * the FOSS MT platform Apertium
;;  * the Google service at translate.google.com
;;  * the Transparent Language motor at FreeTranslation.com

;;
;; Entry points: either 'M-x babel', which prompts for a phrase, a
;; language pair and a backend, or 'M-x babel-region', which prompts
;; for a language pair and backend, then translates the currently
;; selected region, and 'M-x babel-buffer' to translate the current
;; buffer.
;;

;; If you ask for a language combination which several backends could
;; translate, babel.el will allow you to choose which backend to
;; use. Since most servers have limits on the quantity of text
;; translated, babel.el will split long requests into translatable
;; chunks and submit them sequentially.
;;
;; Please note that the washing process (which takes the raw HTML
;; returned by a translation server and attempts to extract the useful
;; information) is fragile, and can easily be broken by a change in
;; the server's output format. In that case, check whether a new
;; version is available (and if not, warn me; I don't translate into
;; Welsh very often).
;;
;; Also note that by accessing an online translation service you are
;; bound by its Terms and Conditions; in particular
;; FreeTranslation.com is for \"personal, non-commercial use only\".
;;
;;
;; Installation ========================================================
;;
;; Place this file in a directory in your load-path (to see a list of
;; appropriate directories, type 'C-h v load-path RET'). Optionally
;; byte-compile the file (for example using the 'B' key when the
;; cursor is on the filename in a dired buffer). Then add the
;; following lines to your ~/.emacs.el initialization file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'babel \"babel\"
;;     \"Use a web translation service to translate the message MSG.\" t)
;;   (autoload 'babel-region \"babel\"
;;     \"Use a web translation service to translate the current region.\" t)
;;   (autoload 'babel-as-string \"babel\"
;;     \"Use a web translation service to translate MSG, returning a string.\" t)
;;   (autoload 'babel-buffer \"babel\"
;;     \"Use a web translation service to translate the current buffer.\" t)
;;
;; babel.el requires emacs >= 23
;;
;;
;; Backend information =================================================
;;
;; A babel backend named <zob> must provide three functions:
;;
;;    (babel-<zob>-translation from to)
;;
;;    where FROM and TO are three-letter language abbreviations from
;;    the alist `babel-languages'. This should return non-nil if the
;;    backend is capable of translating between these two languages.
;;
;;    (babel-<zob>-fetch msg from to)
;;
;;    where FROM and TO are as above, and MSG is the text to
;;    translate. Connect to the appropriate server and fetch the raw
;;    HTML corresponding to the request.
;;
;;    (babel-<zob>-wash)
;;
;;    When called on a buffer containing the raw HTML provided by the
;;    server, remove all the uninteresting text and HTML markup.
;;
;; I would be glad to incorporate backends for new translation servers
;; which are accessible to the general public.
;;
;; babel.el was inspired by a posting to the ding list by Steinar Bang
;; <sb@metis.no>. Morten Eriksen <mortene@sim.no> provided several
;; patches to improve InterTrans washing. Thanks to Per Abrahamsen and
;; Thomas Lofgren for pointing out a bug in the keymap code. Matt
;; Hodges <pczmph@unix.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk> suggested ignoring case
;; on completion. Colin Marquardt suggested
;; `babel-preferred-to-language'. David Masterson suggested adding a
;; menu item. Andy Stewart provided
;; `babel-remember-window-configuration' functionality, output window
;; adjustments and more improvements.
;;
;; User quotes: Dieses ist die gr\303\266\303\237te Sache seit geschnittenem Brot.

;;
;;    Automatically resize one-window frames to fit.
;;
;;  Functions are provided here to automatically resize each frame to
;;  fit its selected window, when there is no other window in the
;;  frame.  Some standard Emacs primitive functions are redefined to
;;  do this: `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only),
;;  `switch-to-buffer', and `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only).
;;
;;  Prior to Emacs 23, automatic frame resizing is also provided here
;;  implicitly for functions `switch-to-buffer-other-window' and
;;  `switch-to-buffer-other-frame', since they ultimately use
;;  `display-buffer', and so the version of it defined here.  (Command
;;  `switch-to-buffer' does not use `display-buffer' - it is redefined
;;  separately here, for all Emacs versions.)
;;
;;  Put the following in your Emacs initialization file (`~/.emacs'),
;;  in order to provide for automatic frame resizing:
;;
;;    (require 'autofit-frame)
;;    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'fit-frame)
;;
;;  The second line here causes newly created frames to be fitted to
;;  their buffer (window).  Even if you load `auto-fit-frames.el', you
;;  will still need to do this, because `display-buffer' and so on are
;;  not called when a new frame is created.
;;
;;  To automatically fit frames that show a temporary buffer in their
;;  sole window, add this to your initialization file also:
;;
;;    (add-hook 'temp-buffer-show-hook
;;              'fit-frame-if-one-window 'append)
;;
;;  User option (variable) `autofit-frames-flag' turns on and off the
;;  automatic resizing defined here.  Setting it to nil turns it off:
;;  (setq autofit-frames-flag nil).  You can also bind it to nil to
;;  temporarily inhibit frame resizing in Lisp code:
;;
;;         (let ((autofit-frames-flag nil))...)
;;
;;
;;  New user option (variable) defined here: `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;  New function defined here (useful as a `temp-buffer-show-hook'):
;;
;;    `fit-frame-if-one-window'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following function defined in `window.el' has been
;;              REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `window--display-buffer-1' (Emacs 23+) -
;;     Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'.
;;
;;
;;  ***** NOTE: The following EMACS PRIMITIVES are REDEFINED HERE:
;;
;;  `display-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (and provided buffer was not yet displayed).
;;     3) Raise the frame.
;;     4) Restore point in buffer - fixes unknown Emacs 22 bug.
;;
;;  `pop-to-buffer' (prior to Emacs 23 only) -
;;     Use the `display-buffer' defined here.
;;
;;  `switch-to-buffer' (all Emacs versions) -
;;     1) Use `read-buffer' in interactive spec.
;;     2) If current window is dedicated, then use another window.
;;     3) Resize frame to fit sole window if `autofit-frames-flag'
;;        (unless BUFFER is already the `current-buffer').
;;
;;
;;  This file loads file `fit-frame.el', which provides the main
;;  functionality behind the automatic frame resizing.  See it for
;;  user options to do such things as customize default frame sizes.
;;
;;  The reason for separating the code here from that in
;;  `fit-frame.el' is to let you load that code but not load the code
;;  here, if you do not want to redefine Emacs primitives.
;;
;;  This file was formerly called `shrink-fit-all.el', then
;;  `auto-resize-frames.el'.
;;
;;
;;  See also these files for other frame commands:
;;
;;     `doremi-frm.el'    - Incrementally adjust frame properties
;;                          using arrow keys and/or mouse wheel.
;;
;;     `frame-cmds.el'    - Miscellaneous frame and window commands.
;;
;;     `thumb-frm.el'     - Shrink frames to a thumbnail size and

;; * About auto-indent-mode
;; Provides auto-indentation minor mode for Emacs.  This allows the
;; following: 
;; 
;;   - Return automatically indents the code appropriately (if enabled)
;; 
;;   - Pasting/Yanking indents the appropriately
;; 
;;   - Killing line will take off unneeded spaces (if enabled)
;; 
;;   - On visit file, indent appropriately, but DONT SAVE. (Pretend like
;;     nothing happened, if enabled)
;; 
;;   - On save, optionally unttabify, remove trailing white-spaces, and
;;     definitely indent the file (if enabled).
;; 
;;   - TextMate behavior of keys if desired (see below)
;; 
;;   - Deleting the end of a line will shrink the whitespace to just one
;;     (if desired and enabled)
;; 
;;   - Automatically indent balanced parenthetical expression, or sexp, if desired
;;     `auto-indent-current-pairs' or `auto-indent-next-pair' is set
;;     to be true (disabled by default).  This is not immediate but occurs
;;     after a bit to allow better responsiveness in emacs.
;; 
;;   - Attempts to set the indentation level (number of spaces for an
;;     indent) for a major-mode.
;; 
;; All of these options can be customized. (customize auto-indent)
;; * Installing auto-indent-mode
;; 
;; To use put this in your load path and then put the following in your emacs
;; file:
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-on-visit-file t) ;; If you want auto-indent on for files
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; If you (almost) always want this on, add the following to ~/.emacs:
;; 
;; 
;;    (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; Excluded modes are defined in `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; 
;; If you only want this on for a single mode, you would add the following to
;; ~/.emacs
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'auto-indent-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; You could always turn on the minor mode with the command
;; `auto-indent-mode'
;; * Auto-indent and repositories
;; auto-indent-mode will now be more conservative when it determines
;; that you are in a repository.  It will only indent the local area you
;; are editing.  This can be changed to be conservative everywhere by:
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-indent-style 'conservative)
;; 
;; 
;; You can revert to the old behavior of aggressive by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-indent-style 'aggressive)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; * Setting the number of spaces for indenting major modes
;; While this is controlled by the major mode, as a convenience,
;; auto-indent-mode attempts to set the default number of spaces for an
;; indentation for specific major mode.  
;; 
;; This is done by:
;; 1. Making local variables of all the variables specified in
;;    `auto-indent-known-indent-level-variables' and setting them to
;;    auto-indent's `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'
;; 2. Looking to see if major mode variables
;;    `major-mode-indent-level' and `major-mode-basic-offset' variables
;;    are present.  If either of these variables are present,
;;    `auto-indent-mode' sets these variables to the default
;;    `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'.   
;; 
;; * TextMate Meta-Return behavior
;; If you would like TextMate behavior of Meta-RETURN going to the
;; end of the line and then inserting a newline, as well as
;; Meta-shift return going to the end of the line, inserting a
;; semi-colon then inserting a newline, use the following:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-then-newline \"<M-return>\")
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-insert-char-then-newline \"<M-S-return>\")
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;;   (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; This may or may not work on your system.  Many times emacs cannot
;; distinguish between M-RET and M-S-RET, so if you don't mind a
;; slight redefinition use:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-then-newline \"<M-return>\")
;;   (setq auto-indent-key-for-end-of-line-insert-char-then-newline \"<C-M-return>\")
;;   (require 'auto-indent-mode)
;;   (auto-indent-global-mode)
;; 
;; 
;; If you want to insert something other than a semi-colon (like a
;; colon) in a specific mode, say colon-mode, do the following:
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-hook 'colon-mode-hook (lambda () (setq auto-indent-eol-char \":\")))
;; 
;; * Notes about autopair-mode and yasnippet compatibility
;; If you wish to use this with autopairs and yasnippet, please load
;; this library first.
;; * Using specific functions from auto-indent-mode
;; 
;; Also if you wish to just use specific functions from this library
;; that is possible as well.
;; 
;; To have the auto-indentation delete characters use:
;; 
;; 
;;   
;;   (autoload 'auto-indent-delete-char \"auto-indent-mode\" \"\" t)
;;   (define-key global-map [remap delete-char] 'auto-indent-delete-char)
;;   
;;   (autoload 'auto-indent-kill-line \"auto-indent-mode\" \"\" t)
;;   (define-key global-map [remap kill-line] 'auto-indent-kill-line)
;;   
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; However, this does not honor the excluded modes in
;; `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; 
;; 
;; * Making certain modes perform tasks on paste/yank.
;; Sometimes, like in R, it is convenient to paste c:\\ and change it to
;; c:/.  This can be accomplished by modifying the
;; `auto-indent-after-yank-hook'.
;; 
;; The code for changing the paths is as follows:
;; 
;; 
;;   (defun kicker-ess-fix-path (beg end)
;;     \"Fixes ess path\"
;;     (save-restriction
;;       (save-excursion
;;         (narrow-to-region beg end)
;;         (goto-char (point-min))
;;         (when (looking-at \"[A-Z]:\\\\\\\\\")
;;           (while (search-forward \"\\\\\" nil t)
;;             (replace-match \"/\"))))))
;;   
;;   (defun kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-path ()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (when (string= \"S\" ess-language)
;;       (add-hook 'auto-indent-after-yank-hook 'kicker-ess-fix-path t t)))
;;   (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-path)
;; 
;; 
;; Another R-hack is to take of the \">\" and \"+\" of a command line
;; copy. For example copying:
;; 
;;  > 
;;  > availDists <- c(Normal=\"rnorm\", Exponential=\"rexp\")
;;  > availKernels <- c(\"gaussian\", \"epanechnikov\", \"rectangular\",
;;  + \"triangular\", \"biweight\", \"cosine\", \"optcosine\")
;; 
;; 
;; Should give the following code on paste:
;; 
;;  
;;  availDists <- c(Normal=\"rnorm\", Exponential=\"rexp\")
;;  availKernels <- c(\"gaussian\", \"epanechnikov\", \"rectangular\",
;;  \"triangular\", \"biweight\", \"cosine\", \"optcosine\")
;; 
;; 
;; This is setup by the following code snippet:
;; 
;; 
;;   (defun kicker-ess-fix-code (beg end)
;;     \"Fixes ess path\"
;;     (save-restriction
;;       (save-excursion
;;         (save-match-data
;;           (narrow-to-region beg end)
;;           (goto-char (point-min))
;;           (while (re-search-forward \"^[ \\t]*[>][ \\t]+\" nil t)
;;             (replace-match \"\")
;;             (goto-char (point-at-eol))
;;             (while (looking-at \"[ \\t\\n]*[+][ \\t]+\")
;;               (replace-match \"\\n\")
;;               (goto-char (point-at-eol))))))))
;;   
;;   (defun kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-code ()
;;     (interactive)
;;     (when (string= \"S\" ess-language)
;;       (add-hook 'auto-indent-after-yank-hook 'kicker-ess-fix-code t t)))
;;   (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'kicker-ess-turn-on-fix-code)
;; 
;; 
;; * Auto-indent and org-mode
;; Auto-indent does not technically turn on for org-mode.  Instead the
;; following can be added/changed:
;; 
;; 1. `org-indent-mode' is turned on when `auto-indent-start-org-indent'

;; * FAQ
;; ** Why isn't my mode indenting?
;; Some modes are excluded for compatability reasons, such as
;; text-modes.  This is controlled by the variable
;; `auto-indent-disabled-modes-list'
;; ** Why isn't my specific mode have the right number of spaces?
;; Actually, the number of spaces for indentation is controlled by the
;; major mode. If there is a major-mode specific variable that controls
;; this offset, you can add this variable to
;; `auto-indent-known-indent-level-variables' to change the indentation
;; for this mode when auto-indent-mode starts.
;; 
;; See:
;; 
;; - [[http://www.pement.org/emacs_tabs.htm][Understanding GNU Emacs and tabs]]
;; - [[http://kb.iu.edu/data/abde.html][In Emacs how can I change tab sizes?]]
;; *** How do I add a variable to the auto-indent tab offset?
;; You can add the variable by using =M-x customize-group
;; auto-indent-mode= and then add the variable to
;; `auto-indent-known-indent-levels'.  Another way is to use lisp:
;; 
;; 
;;   (add-to-list 'auto-indent-known-indent-levels 'c-basic-offset)
;; 
;; 
;; *** How do I change the auto-indent default offset?
;; You can change auto-indent's default offset by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-assign-indent-level 4) ; Changes the indent level to
;;                                           ; 4 spaces instead of 2.
;; 
;; 
;; *** How do I turn of auto-indent assignment?
;; When auto-indent finds a tab-size variable, it assigns the indentation
;; level to the globally defined `auto-indent-assign-indent-level'.  If
;; you do not want this to happen you can turn it off by
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-assign-indent-level-variables nil)
;; 
;; 
;; ** Why is auto-indent-mode changing tabs to spaces
;; I prefer tabs instead of spaces.  You may prefer the other way.  The
;; options to change this are:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-mode-untabify-on-yank-or-paste nil)
;; 
;; 
;; to keep tabs upon paste.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-visit-file nil) ; Already disabled
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; To keep tabs upon visiting a file.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-save-file nil)
;; 
;; 
;; to turn off changing tabs to spaces on file save.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-backward-delete-char-behavior nil) ; Just delete one character.
;; 
;; 
;; So that backspace doesn't change tabs to spaces.
;; 
;; If you wish to be more extreme you can also change spaces to tabs by:
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-mode-untabify-on-yank-or-paste 'tabify)
;; 
;; 
;; to keep tabs upon paste.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-visit-file 'tabify) ; I would suggest
;;                                           ; leaving this off.
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; To keep tabs upon visiting a file.
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-untabify-on-save-file 'tabify)
;; 
;; 
;; 
;; ** Argh -- Auto-indent is messing with my indentation.  What can I do?
;; If you do not like the default indentation style of a particular
;; mode, sometimes you may adjust the indetation by hand.  Then you
;; press the return button and all your hard work is erased.  This can
;; be quite frustrating.  
;; 
;; What is happening, is that auto-indent is fixing the current line's
;; indentation and then indenting the next line on pressing enter.  This
;; can be turned off customizing the `auto-indent-newline-function' to
;; 
;; 
;;   (setq auto-indent-newline-function 'newline-and-indent) 
;; 
;; 
;; This will insert a newline and then indent.  Not reindent according
;; to the major mode's conventions.

;; This package provides two minor modes which automatically recompile
;; Emacs Lisp source files.  Together these modes guarantee that Emacs
;; never loads outdated byte code files.

;; `auto-compile-on-save-mode' recompiles source files when they are
;; being saved and `auto-compile-on-load-mode' does so before they are
;; being loaded.  Both modes only _recompile_ a source file when the
;; respective byte code file exists and is outdated.  Otherwise (when
;; the byte code file doesn't exist or is up-to-date) these modes do
;; _not_ compile the source file.

;; To permanently or temporarily toggle automatic compilation of some
;; source file use the command `toggle-auto-compile'.  Since the modes
;; only ever _update_ byte code files, toggling automatic compilation
;; is done simply by either creating the byte code file or removing
;; it.  `toggle-auto-compile' can also toggle automatic compilation of
;; multiple files at once; see it's doc-string for more information.

;; Even when using `auto-compile-on-save-mode' it can happen that some
;; source file is newer than the respective byte code file.  This can
;; for example happen when performing version control operations and
;; is a problem because Emacs always loads the byte code file even
;; when the respective source file has been modified since the former
;; was created.

;; To prevent outdated byte code files from being loaded
;; `auto-compile-on-load-mode' advises `require' and `load' to first
;; recompile a source file if it is newer than the respective byte
;; code file.

;; Enabling `auto-compile-on-load-mode' as early as possible reduces
;; the risk of loading an outdated byte code file.  It is best if you
;; enable both modes together at the beginning of your init file, even
;; before loading your package manager and having it initialize the
;; `load-path'.

;;     ;; -*- no-byte-compile: t -*-
;;     (add-to-list 'load-path \"/path/to/auto-compile\")
;;     (require 'auto-compile)
;;     (auto-compile-on-load-mode 1)
;;     (auto-compile-on-save-mode 1)

;; Automatically compilation of Emacs Lisp source files is useful for
;; at least the following reasons:

;; \342\227\206 Emacs prefers the byte code file over the source file even if the
;;   former is outdated.  If you have to do the compilation manually
;;   you will at least occasionally forget to do so and end up with an
;;   old version of your code being loaded.

;; \342\227\206 There are many otherwise fine libraries to be found on the
;;   Internet which when compiled will confront the user with a wall
;;   of compile warnings and an occasional error.  If authors are
;;   informed about these (often trivial) problems after each save
;;   they will likely fix them quite quickly.  That or they have a
;;   high noise tolerance.

;; \342\227\206 It's often easier and less annoying to fix errors and warnings as
;;   they are introduced than to do a \"let's compile today's work and
;;   see how it goes\".

;; This package is designed to stay out of your way as much as it can
;; while still motivating you to get things fixed.  That might be
;; annoying initially but less so once existing problems have been
;; fixed.  By default Auto-Compile won't let you quit Emacs on the
;; first attempt without fixing fatal errors in visited source files
;; first.  To disable this set `auto-compile-mark-failed-modified' to
;; nil.

;; Also note that just because no warnings and/or errors are reported
;; when a source file is compiled by the modes defined here this does
;; not necessarily mean that users of your libraries won't see any.  A
;; likely cause for this would be that you forgot to require a feature
;; which is loaded on your system but not necessarily on the users'
;; systems.  So you should still manually compile your packages before
;; release:
;;

;; speech recognition work from my phone. Instead, I decided to just
;; record audio notes, and I wrote this package to automate the
;; process of playing them back at the computer.
;;
;; I found this to be even faster, because I don't have to wait and

;; smartphone into a directory on your PC. But you're free to use it
;; in other ways.
;;
;; When you activate this mode, it will play the first audio note in a
;; specific directory and wait for you to write it down. Once you're
;; finished, just call the next note with \\\\[anm/play-next]. When you
;; do this, `audio-notes-mode' will DELETE the note which was already
;; played and start playing the next one. Once you've gone through all

;; Introduction
;; ------------
;;
;; This package provides a way to display ASCII code on a window, that is,
;; display in another window an ASCII table highlighting the current character
;; code.
;;
;; Well, maybe the name \"ascii\" is not a good name for this package, as this
;; package also displays non-ASCII code, that is, character code which is
;; greater than 255.  It also displays characters codified in HTML (&Aacute;),
;; quoted (=20), escaped (\\xFF) and Emacs Lisp character (?\\^A).
;;
;; To use ascii, insert in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'ascii)
;;
;; Or:
;;
;;    (autoload 'ascii-on        \"ascii\" \"Turn on ASCII code display.\"   t)
;;    (autoload 'ascii-off       \"ascii\" \"Turn off ASCII code display.\"  t)
;;    (autoload 'ascii-display   \"ascii\" \"Toggle ASCII code display.\"    t)
;;    (autoload 'ascii-customize \"ascii\" \"Customize ASCII code display.\" t)
;;
;; For good performance, be sure to byte-compile ascii.el, e.g.
;;
;;    M-x byte-compile-file <give the path to ascii.el when prompted>
;;
;; This will generate ascii.elc, which will be loaded instead of ascii.el.
;;
;; It runs on GNU Emacs 20.4.1, 21, 22 and 23.
;;
;;
;; Using ascii
;; -----------
;;
;; To activate ascii, type:
;;
;;    M-x ascii-on RET
;;
;; Or:
;;
;;    C-u 1 M-x ascii-display RET
;;
;; To deactivate ascii, type:
;;
;;    M-x ascii-off RET
;;
;; Or:
;;
;;    C-u 0 M-x ascii-display RET
;;
;; To toggle ascii, type:
;;
;;    M-x ascii-display RET
;;
;; To customize ascii, type:
;;
;;    M-x ascii-customize RET
;;
;; You can also bind `ascii-display', `ascii-on', `ascii-off' and
;; `ascii-customize' to some key, like:
;;
;;    (global-set-key \"\\C-c\\C-a\" 'ascii-on)
;;    (global-set-key \"\\C-c\\C-e\" 'ascii-off)
;;    (global-set-key \"\\C-c\\C-t\" 'ascii-display)
;;    (global-set-key \"\\C-c\\C-c\" 'ascii-customize)
;;
;; If you're using `mule' package, a good usage example is to activate `ascii'
;; on emacs/etc/HELLO file.
;;
;;
;; Hooks
;; -----
;;
;; ascii has the following hook variable:
;;
;; `ascii-hook'
;;    It is evaluated once when ascii is turned on.
;;
;;
;; Options
;; -------
;;
;; Below it's shown a brief description of ascii options, please, see the
;; options declaration in the code for a long documentation.
;;
;; `ascii-code'				Specify list of character code to
;;					display.
;;
;; `ascii-show-nonascii'		Non-nil means converts to unibyte and
;;					display the ascii code.
;;
;; `ascii-show-nonascii-message'	Non-nil means show a message when
;;					character is above 255.
;;
;; `ascii-window-size'			Specify initial ASCII window size.
;;
;; `ascii-display-code'			Specify list of character range to be
;;					displayed.
;;
;; `ascii-keep-window'			Non-nil means to keep ASCII window
;;					active.
;;
;; `ascii-table-separator'		Specify string used to separate ASCII
;;					table columns.
;;
;; `ascii-ascii-face'			Specify symbol face used to highlight
;;					ascii code.
;;
;; `ascii-non-ascii-face'		Specify symbol face used to highlight
;;					non-ascii code.
;;
;; To set the above options you may:
;;
;; a) insert the code in your ~/.emacs, like:
;;
;;	 (setq ascii-window-size 6)
;;
;;    This way always keep your default settings when you enter a new Emacs
;;    session.
;;
;; b) or use `set-variable' in your Emacs session, like:
;;
;;	 M-x set-variable RET ascii-window-size RET 6 RET
;;
;;    This way keep your settings only during the current Emacs session.
;;
;; c) or use customization, for example:
;;	 click on menu-bar *Help* option,
;;	 then click on *Customize*,
;;	 then click on *Browse Customization Groups*,
;;	 expand *Data* group,
;;	 expand *Ascii* group
;;	 and then customize ascii options.
;;    Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
;;    you leave out the current Emacs session.
;;
;; d) or see the option value:
;;
;;	 C-h v ascii-window-size RET
;;
;;    and click the *customize* hypertext button.
;;    Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
;;    you leave out the current Emacs session.
;;
;; e) or invoke:
;;
;;	 M-x ascii-customize RET
;;
;;    and then customize ascii options.
;;    Through this way, you may choose if the settings are kept or not when
;;    you leave out the current Emacs session.

;; Explanation
;;
;; Anaphoric expressions implicitly create one or more temporary

"]) (alert . [(20130510 20) nil "Growl-style notification system for Emacs" single ";;; Commentary:

;; Alert is a Growl-workalike for Emacs which uses a common notification
;; interface and multiple, selectable \"styles\", whose use is fully
;; customizable by the user.
;;
;; * For module writers
;;
;; Just use `alert' instead of `message' as follows:
;;
;;   (require 'alert)
;;
;;   ;; This is the most basic form usage
;;   (alert \"This is an alert\")
;;
;;   ;; You can adjust the severity for more important messages
;;   (alert \"This is an alert\" :severity 'high)
;;
;;   ;; Or decrease it for purely informative ones
;;   (alert \"This is an alert\" :severity 'trivial)
;;
;;   ;; Alerts can have optional titles.  Otherwise, the title is the
;;   ;; buffer-name of the (current-buffer) where the alert originated.
;;   (alert \"This is an alert\" :title \"My Alert\")
;;
;;   ;; Further, alerts can have categories.  This allows users to
;;   ;; selectively filter on them.
;;   (alert \"This is an alert\" :title \"My Alert\" :category 'debug)
;;
;; * For users
;;
;; For the user, there are several variables to control when and how alerts
;; are presented.  By default, they appear in the minibuffer much the same
;; as a normal Emacs message.  But there are many more possibilities:
;;
;;   `alert-fade-time'
;;     Normally alerts disappear after this many seconds, if the style
;;     supports it.  The default is 5 seconds.
;;
;;   `alert-default-style'
;;     Pick the style to use if no other config rule matches.  The
;;     default is `message', but `growl' works well too.
;;
;;   `alert-reveal-idle-time'
;;     If a config rule choose to match on `idle', this is how many
;;     seconds idle the user has to be.  Defaults to 5 so that users
;;     don't miss any alerts, but 120 is also good.
;;
;;   `alert-persist-idle-time'
;;     After this many idle seconds, alerts will become sticky, and not
;;     fade away more.  The default is 15 minutes.
;;
;;   `alert-log-messages'
;;     By default, all alerts are logged to *Alerts* (and to *Messages*,
;;     if the `message' style is being used).  Set to nil to disable.
;;
;;   `alert-hide-all-notifications'
;;     Want alerts off entirely?  They still get logged, however, unless
;;     you've turned that off too.
;;
;;   `alert-user-configuration'
;;     This variable lets you control exactly how and when a particular
;;     alert, a class of alerts, or all alerts, get reported -- or if at
;;     all.  Use this to make some alerts use Growl, while others are
;;     completely silent.
;;
;; * Programmatically adding rules
;;
;; Users can also programmatically add configuration rules, in addition to
;; customizing `alert-user-configuration'.  Here is one that the author
;; currently uses with ERC, so that the fringe gets colored whenever people
;; chat on BitlBee:
;;
;;  (alert-add-rule :status   '(buried visible idle)
;;                  :severity '(moderate high urgent)
;;                  :mode     'erc-mode
;;                  :predicate
;;                  #'(lambda (info)
;;                      (string-match (concat \"\\\\`[^&].*@BitlBee\\\\'\")
;;                                    (erc-format-target-and/or-network)))
;;                  :persistent
;;                  #'(lambda (info)
;;                      ;; If the buffer is buried, or the user has been
;;                      ;; idle for `alert-reveal-idle-time' seconds,
;;                      ;; make this alert persistent.  Normally, alerts
;;                      ;; become persistent after
;;                      ;; `alert-persist-idle-time' seconds.
;;                      (memq (plist-get info :status) '(buried idle)))
;;                  :style 'fringe
;;                  :continue t)
;;
;; * Builtin alert styles
;;
;; There are several builtin styles, and it is trivial to create new ones.
;; The builtins are:
;;
;;   message  - Uses the Emacs `message' facility
;;   log      - Logs the alert text to *Alerts*, with a timestamp
;;   ignore   - Ignores the alert entirely
;;   fringe   - Changes the current frame's fringe background color
;;   growl    - Uses Growl on OS X, if growlnotify is on the PATH
;;   notifier - Uses terminal-notifier on OS X, if it is on the PATH
;;
;; * Defining new styles
;;
;; To create a new style, you need to at least write a \"notifier\", which is
;; a function that receives the details of the alert.  These details are
;; given in a plist which uses various keyword to identify the parts of the
;; alert.  Here is a prototypical style definition:
;;
;;  (alert-define-style 'style-name :title \"My Style's title\"
;;                      :notifier
;;                      (lambda (info)
;;                        ;; The message text is :message

  \"Alert the user that something has happened.
MESSAGE is what the user will see.  You may also use keyword
arguments to specify additional details.  Here is a full example:

\\(alert \\\"This is a message\\\"
       :severity 'high          ;; The default severity is `normal'
       :title \\\"Title\\\"         ;; An optional title
       :category 'example       ;; A symbol to identify the message
       :mode 'text-mode         ;; Normally determined automatically
       :buffer (current-buffer) ;; This is the default
       :data nil                ;; Unused by alert.el itself
       :persistent nil          ;; Force the alert to be persistent;
                                ;; it is best not to use this
       :never-persist nil       ;; Force this alert to never persist
       :style 'fringe)          ;; Force a given style to be used;
                                ;; this is only for debugging!

If no :title is given, the buffer-name of :buffer is used.  If
:buffer is nil, it is the current buffer at the point of call.

:data is an opaque value which modules can pass through to their
own styles if they wish.

Here are some more typical examples of usage:

  ;; This is the most basic form usage
  (alert \\\"This is an alert\\\")

  ;; You can adjust the severity for more important messages
  (alert \\\"This is an alert\\\" :severity 'high)

  ;; Or decrease it for purely informative ones
  (alert \\\"This is an alert\\\" :severity 'trivial)

  ;; Alerts can have optional titles.  Otherwise, the title is the
  ;; buffer-name of the (current-buffer) where the alert originated.
  (alert \\\"This is an alert\\\" :title \\\"My Alert\\\")

  ;; Further, alerts can have categories.  This allows users to
  ;; selectively filter on them.
  (alert \\\"This is an alert\\\" :title \\\"My Alert\\\"
         :category 'some-category-or-other)\"

;; This library provides support for saving files in an encrypted form
;; by using Cipher-block chaining [4] and Offset Codebook Mode [5].
;; Both use Rijndael [1] as encryption algorithm, which is implemented
;; natively in Emacs.  Rijndael is a superset of the AES algorithm
;; [2].  For patent issues about OCB see [6], which allows this
;; distribution.  Additionally this library provides a password
;; generator based on AES and random user input.

;; Config file
;; Insert \"(require 'aes)\" into your local .emacs file to load this
;; library.
;; Insert \"(aes-enable-auto-decryption)\" into yout local .emacs file
;; for convenient automatic recognization of encrypted files during
;; loading.

;; Whenever possible, this library should be used byte-compiled, as
;; this provides a really great performance boost!

;; Main entry points:

;; `aes-encrypt-current-buffer' / `aes-decrypt-current-buffer' Ask for
;; password and encrypt / decrypt current buffer.
;; `aes-insert-password' Generate a random password from user input.

;; For customizing this library, there is the customization group aes
;; in the applications group.

;; Emacs versions 22 to 23 are recommended.  It should work with
;; version 21 and 24, but there were no tests.

;; This implementation allows additionally to the AES specification
;; blocklengths of 24 and 32 bytes.

;; Nb denotes the number of 32-bit words in the state.
;; Nk denotes the number of 32-bit words comprising the cipher key.
;; Nr denotes the number of rounds.
;; We allow Nb and Nk to be 4, 6, or 8. and Nr = max(Nb, Nk) + 6

;; Since Emacs implements integers as 29 bit numbers, it is not
;; possible to use the optimization, which requires 32 bit numbers.
;; For details see [3].  This leads to an 8-bit design for this
;; implementation.  So the following fitting implementation is used
;; here.
;; - Multiplication and inverting in GF(2^8) are implemented as a
;; - table lookups.
;; - The state is implemented as a string of length 4 * Nb.
;; - Plaintext and ciphertext are implemented as unibyte strings.
;; - The expanded key is implemented as a list of length 4 * Nb * (1 +
;;   Nr) with entries '((A . B) . (C . D)), where A, B, C and D are
;;   bytes.  It is precalculated before the en-/decryption algorithms.
;; - The S-boxes are implemented by lookup tables.
;; - The three operations ByteSub, ShiftRow and MixColumn together
;;   with round-key-addition are implemented in the functions
;;   `aes-SubShiftMixKeys' and `aes-InvSubShiftMixKeys' for encryption
;;   and decryption respectively.
;; - CBC mode is implemented straightforward, using a Zero or PKCS#7
;;   [7] padding.  The IV is appended to and saved with the
;;   ciphertext.
;; - OCB mode made the implementation of a pmac, based on AES,
;;   necessary, but the further details were straightforward.  The IV
;;   is appended to the ciphertext.  During decryption the created
;;   hash-value is checked.
;; - the function `aes-key-from-passwd' generates an AES key from an
;;   user input string (password).
;; - Further a facility is provided to generate random passwords,
;;   based on random user input like mousemovement, time and keyinput.
;; - The ciphertext is usually converted to a base-64 encoded string.

;; The version of the internal storage format of encrypted data is 1.2.

;; Known Bugs / TODO:
;; - Encrypted buffers are Auto-Saved unencrypted.
;; - This implementation is not resistant against DPA attacks [8].
;; - `aes-auto-decrypt' is not completely compliant to Emacs standards.
;; - Handle CBC and OCB in two different functions instead of the
;;   single function `aes-encrypt-buffer-or-string'.
;; - `aes-enlarge-to-multiple-num' is a really bad function name.
;; - don't handle padding in `aes-cbc-encrypt'.

;; 
;; # Introduction 
;; 
;; [AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) is a text document format for
;; writing short documents, articles, books and UNIX man pages. AsciiDoc files
;; can be translated to HTML and DocBook markups.
;; 
;; adoc-mode is an Emacs major mode for editing AsciiDoc files. It emphasizes on
;; the idea that the document is highlighted so it pretty much looks like the
;; final output. What must be bold is bold, what must be italic is italic etc.
;; Meta characters are naturally still visible, but in a faint way, so they can
;; be easily ignored.
;; 
;; 
;; # Download 
;; 
;; The raw file (adoc-mode.el) can be found
;; [here](https://raw.github.com/sensorflo/adoc-mode/master/adoc-mode.el).
;; Optionally you can get the sources from the [git
;; repository](https://github.com/sensorflo/adoc-mode).
;; 
;; You will also need to download the library
;; [markup-faces](https://github.com/sensorflo/markup-faces). If you install
;; adoc-mode via Emacs Lisp Packages, see below, markup-faces is installed
;; automatically if you don't have it yet.
;; 
;; 
;; # Installation 
;; 
;; Installation is as usual, so if you are proficient with Emacs you don't need
;; to read this.
;; 
;; ## Install the traditional way
;; 
;; 1. Copy the file adoc-mode.el to a directory in your load-path, e.g.
;;    \\~/.emacs.d. To add a specific directory to the load path, add this to our
;;    initialization file (probably ~/.emacs): `(add-to-list 'load-path
;;    \"mypath\")`
;; 
;; 2. Add either of the two following lines to your initialization file. The
;;    first only loads adoc mode when necessary, the 2nd always during startup
;;    of Emacs.
;; 
;;    * `(autoload 'adoc-mode \"adoc-mode\")`
;; 
;;    * `(require 'adoc-mode)`
;; 
;; 3. Optionally byte compile adoc-mode.el for faster startup: `M-x
;;    byte-compile`
;; 
;; 4. To use adoc mode, call adoc-mode after you opened an AsciiDoc file: `M-x
;;    adoc-mode`
;; 
;; 
;; ## Install via Emacs Lisp Packages (on Marmalade)
;; 
;; For this way you either need packages.el from
;; [here](https://github.com/technomancy/package.el) and or Emacs 24, where the
;; packages library is already included. adoc-mode is on the
;; [Marmalade](http://marmalade-repo.org/) package archive.
;; 
;; * Type `M-x package-install RET adoc-mode RET`.
;; 
;; 
;; ## Possible steps after installation
;; 
;; Each of the following is optional
;; 
;; * According to AsciiDoc manual, .txt is the standard file extension of
;;   AsciiDoc files. Add the following to your initialization file to open all
;;   .txt files with adoc-mode as major mode automatically: `(add-to-list
;;   'auto-mode-alist (cons \"\\\\.txt\\\\'\" 'adoc-mode))`
;; 
;; * If your default face is a fixed pitch (monospace) face, but in AsciiDoc
;;   files you liked to have normal text with a variable pitch face,
;;   buffer-face-mode is for you: `(add-hook 'adoc-mode-hook (lambda()
;;   (buffer-face-mode t)))`
;; 
;; 
;; # Features
;; 
;; - sophisticated highlighting
;; 
;; - promote / denote title
;; 
;; - toggle title type between one line title and two line title
;; 
;; - adjust underline length of a two line title to match title text's length
;; 
;; - goto anchor defining a given id, default reading from xref at point
;; 
;; - support for outline (however only with the one-line title style)
;; 
;; 
;; ## Coming features
;; 
;; The next features I plan to implement
;; 
;; - Denote / promote for list items
;; - Outline support also for two line titles
;; - Correctly highlighting backslash escapes
;; 
;; 
;; # Screenshot
;; 
;; The highlighting emphasizes on how the output will look like. _All_
;; characters are visible, however meta characters are displayed in a faint way.

;;
;; (See https://github.com/vitoshka/ac-math#readme for more)
;;
;; This add-on defines three ac-sources for the
;; *[auto-complete](https://github.com/auto-complete)* package:
;; 
;; * ac-source-latex-commands		  - input latex commands 
;; * ac-source-math-latex		 - input math latex tags  (by default, active only in math environments)
;; 
;; ![symbols](https://raw.github.com/vitoshka/ac-math/master/img/latex-symbols.png)
;; 
;; * ac-source-math-unicode - input of unicode symbols (_by default, active
;; * everywhere except math environments_)
;; 
;; ![math](https://raw.github.com/vitoshka/ac-math/master/img/unicode-math.png)
;; 
;; Start math completion by typing the prefix \"\\\" key. Select the completion
;; type RET (`ac-complete`). Completion on TAB (`ac-expand`) is not working that
;; well as yet.
;; 
;; Depending on the context the unicode symbol or latex \\tag will be inserted.
;; 
;; ## Activation ##
;; 
;; You must have *[auto-complete](https://github.com/auto-complete)* package
;; installed.
;; 
;; Ac-math is available thorough MELPA repository. You can also download
;; [ac-math.el](https://raw.github.com/vitoshka/ac-math/master/ac-math.el)
;; directly and put it into your load-path directory.
;; 
;; This is an example of how to activate the 'ac-math' in latex-mode:
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; 
;; (require 'ac-math)
;; 
;; (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'latex-mode)   ; make auto-complete aware of `latex-mode`
;; 
;; (defun ac-latex-mode-setup ()         ; add ac-sources to default ac-sources
;;   (setq ac-sources
;;         (append '(ac-source-math-unicode ac-source-math-latex ac-source-latex-commands)
;;                 ac-sources))
;;   )
;; 
;; (add-hook 'latex-mode-hook 'ac-latex-mode-setup)
;; ```
;; 
;; If you are using 'flyspell' you might want to activate the
;; [workaround](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/AutoComplete#toc6):
;;
;; ```lisp
;; (ac-flyspell-workaround)
;; ```
;; 
;; ## Unicode Input ##
;; 
;; To use unicode in full force with LaTeX you will need
;; [XeTeX](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=xetex)
;; bundle.
;; 
;; By default unicode input (`ac-source-math-unicode`) is not activated in latex
;; math environments. To activate, do
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; (setq ac-math-unicode-in-math-p t)
;; ```
;; 
;; You can always call UNDO to insert LaTeX command instead of Unicode
;; character. For instance `\\alp RET` inserts the character, then undo reinserts
;; `\\alpha`. Hence, you might consider removing `ac-source-math-latex`
;; altogether from the list of `ac-sources` to increase the completion speed:
;;
;; ```lisp
;; (defun ac-latex-mode-setup ()         
;;   (setq ac-sources
;;         (append '(ac-source-math-unicode ac-source-latex-commands)
;;                 ac-sources))
;;   )
;; ```
;; 
;; Unicode input is not restricted to LaTeX modes and is particularly useful in
;; org-mode (with it's powerful exporting facilities), or web development tools
;; where unicode is crucial.
;; 
;; 
;; Suppose you want it for  mode `XXX`:
;; 
;; ```lisp
;; 
;; (require 'ac-math)
;; 
;; (add-to-list 'ac-modes 'XXX-mode)
;; 
;; (defun ac-XXX-mode-setup ()
;;   (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-math-unicode)
;;   )
;; 
;; (add-hook 'XXX-mode-hook 'ac-XXX-mode-setup)
;; 
;; ```

;; An attempt to get context sensitive Javascript completion in Emacs.
;; Basic completions are obtained by parsing Javascript code with
;; Js2-mode's parser.
;;
;; Installation
;;
;; Easiest way to get ac-js2 is to install it from MELPA. You may need
;; this snippet
;;
;; `(add-to-list 'package-archives
;;              '(\"melpa\" . \"http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/\") t)'
;;
;; if you don't have it already to fetch packages from MELPA.
;;
;; Enable ac-js2 in js2-mode as follows:
;;
;; (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook 'ac-js2-mode)
;;
;; Ac-js2 does not require auto-complete mode but I suggest you grab
;; it anyway as ac-js2 is designed to work with a completion frontend.
;; Support for Company mode is on its way.
;;
;; For more comprehensive completions you can opt to evaluate the code
;; for candidates. A browser needs to be connected to Emacs for the
;; evaluation completions to work. Put this in your init.el file.
;;
;; `(setq ac-js2-evaluate-calls t)'
;;
;; To add completions for external libraries add something like this:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'ac-js2-external-libraries \"path/to/lib/library.js\")
;;
;; Then connect a browser to Emacs by calling `(run-skewer)'. You may
;; need to save the buffer for completions to start.
;;
;; If auto-complete mode is installed on your system then completions
;; should start showing up otherwise use `completion-at-point'.
;;
;; Note: library completions will only work if `ac-js2-evaluate-calls'
;; is set and a browser is connected to Emacs.
;;
;; Bonus: M-. is bound to `ac-js2-jump-to-definition' which will jump
;; to Javascript definitions found in the same buffer. Given the
;; following proprety reference:
;;
;; foo.bar.baz();
;;
;; placing the cursor on `foo', `bar' or `baz' and executing M-. will
;; take you straight to their respective definitions. Use M-, to jump
;; back to where you were. Also works for object literals.
;;
;; Recently added `ac-js2-expand-function' that will expand a function's
;; parameters bound to `C-c C-c`. Expansion will only work if the cursor
;; is after the function.
;;
;; If you have any issues or suggestions please create an issue on Github:
;; https://github.com/ScottyB/ac-js2

;; <<------------  TODOS -------------->>

;; - import something from one of the open files (or repeat existing import)
;;      - when abl-mode is initialized on a file, find the imports, add to list if new
;;      - add command to insert an import
;; - C-c f looks for definition and not just import
;; - navigating to definitions of methods etc. should not be that difficult
;; - add option to return to code window if test runs, is great success,
;;   and window was swtiched from code window.
;; - maybe: parsing output? listing failed tests?
